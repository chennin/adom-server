<HR size = "2">

<P>This list is much more detailed for the versions since 0.9.9 gamma 
six. A really complete and really long list of all the changes 
made to ADOM since its inception can be found at Thomas Biskup's 
official site. The full URL is:

<tr><th>Version<th>Notes

<tr><td>0.2.0<td>first alpha version; only one dungeon; unwinnable
<tr><td>0.4.0<td> Dwarftown, shops, herbs, pools added; first winnable version
<tr><td>0.7.0<td> first public release; color added
<tr><td>0.9.0<td> the game as it appears today comes into existence with a wilderness; ToEF added
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 6<td> no mana temple; chaos god ending was possible; no class powers; no Assassins' Guild; last gamma where RotHK dungeon was a single level; stat increases with herbs were unlimited
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 7<td> suffered from a fatal bug in the mana temple, all walls were undiggable, mindcrafters could still win by teleporting in with their class power; class powers introduced
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 8<td> regarded as a very easy version; several new artifacts; last gamma where drakelings became permanently fast from heat
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 9<td> very difficult version: less item generation, more item destruction, first version where dropped items were destroyed by ranged spells, elemental orbs corrupted merely by carrying; necromancer display bug when creating slaves; first yellow pyramid and color-changing top level of ToEF
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 10 <td> extensively pretested which made this quite stable and balanced; first version where TotRR was available; vortices introduced; crumpled scroll, emperor moloch and quickling bard could be wished for; first implementation of wand of destruction ending; ultra endings were not possible 
because of requirement to wield both Sceptre and Trident at gate entry - Trident is two-handed!; game would sometimes crash unrecoverably upon entering the ID level containing Filk
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 11 <td> firing autotargeted missiles without selecting a target crashed the game
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 12 <td> stable; suffered from annoying bug that made many +0 items possible; last gamma where the & symbol was used for necklaces
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 13 <td> piety loss (much too high) and preferred sacrifices introduced; equipment destruction was ridiculous in this gamma; rivers introduced; room effects introduced; new room connection algorithm made some levels unplayable; short-lived
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 14 <td> piety loss still too high; room connection algorithm fixed
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 15 <td> first attempt at monster inventories: monsters which picked up items would not necessarily drop them when killed - including artifacts like the Chaos Orbs; +0 bug since gamma 12 solved; piety loss toned down again
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 16 - prerelease 1 <td> no entering dungeons?
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 16 - prerelease 2 <td> bugs include a duplicate artifact bug and a strange (integer overflow?) bug that causes weird items (most often daggers with outrageous stats that cannot be picked up) and monsters that deal thousands of points of damage in a single hit - a very rare bug that does not 
make the game unplayable; there is also a duplicating missiles bug <br>
