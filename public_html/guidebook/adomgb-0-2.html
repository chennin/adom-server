<H3>Alignment and Altars</H3>

<b>0.2.1 What is alignment?</b><p>

Alignment reflects the moral nature of the PC.  For example, PCs with lawful alignment 
generally do not slaughter innocents or steal from shops.  Chaotic PCs will do these 
things and a lot worse besides.  Neutral PCs choose from both options, doing nasty things 
when necessary to further their cause, but also performing good acts to maintain their 
balanced alignment.<p>

A general and quite complete description of alignment can be found in the ADOM manual. 
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with that description.  The effects alignment 
have on gameplay are discussed here.  The effects are mostly evident to the player in terms 
of the quests and rewards that are available.<p>

Quests, rewards and alignment restrictions:<p>

Terinyo - quests are available to all PCs regardless of alignment, however Guth'Alak 
          will not reward chaotics with a potion of cure corruption for delivering a 
          chaos creature's corpse<br>
Jharod - will not teach the Healing skill to chaotics, regardless of how Yrrigs is dealt with<br>
Hotzenplotz - quests are available regardless of alignment<br>
Yergius - will not teach the Pick Pockets skill, or anything else, to lawfuls<br>
Old Barbarian - will not give the Courage quest to chaotics<br>
Unicorn quest - Yrruir will not give the quest to kill Riurry to chaotics -
                there is some uncertainty/argument about this<br>
Thrundarr - all quests are available regardless of alignment<br>
Dwarven Mystic - rewards are dependent on alignment; chaotics will receive nothing from him<br>
Kherab - quests are available regardless of alignment<br>
Demented Ratling - assigns a quest only to chaotics<br>
Gaab'Baay - assigns her first quest to chaotics only<br>
Assassin Prince - Filk quest is available regardless of alignment<br>
Sharad-Waador - quest to kill Srraxxarrakex is available regardless of alignment<br>
Mad Minstrel - reveals the location of the scintillating cave regardless of alignment<br>
Khelavaster - will not summon the Trident of the Red Rooster for chaotics<p>


<b>0.2.2 Changing alignment</b><p>

Changing alignment can be done in several ways.  It is easy to change from a lawful flavor 
of alignment to a chaotic one.  The PC need only commit chaotic acts, which include attacking 
non-hostile monsters, reading tracts of chaos, wearing an amulet of chaos, pickpocketing and 
eating undead corpses.  Attacking monsters with a weapon of vampirism or wearing armor of 
chaos will also move alignment towards chaotic in ADOM 1.0.0+.  Changing from chaotic towards 
neutrality and law is more difficult.  A blessed amulet of order, available from Tywat Pare, 
is helpful for this.  Completing lawful quests will move the PC's alignment towards law.  
Examples include the puppy quest, the Yrrigs quest, the Keethrax quest, Tywat Pare's and 
Thrundarr's quests.  Giving food or gold to beggars and seeds to farmers is lawful.  Healing 
the PC's pet (only when actually injured) is a lawful act.  Self-flagellation, using a whip 
in the tool slot, moves alignment towards lawful.  Wearing armor of order draws the PC's 
alignment towards lawful in ADOM 1.0.0+.<p>

Killing monsters affects alignment.  Killing a lawful monster, such as blink dogs or white 
unicorns, even when hostile, is a chaotic act.  Killing certain chaotic monsters, notably most 
dragons, demons, grues, some giants, steel golems and most chaos monsters draws alignment towards 
Law.<p>

All of the above are gradual methods which take some time to accomplish an alignment change.  
Without question, the fastest and easiest way to change alignment is by making sacrifices on 
an altar.  See the section below about altars for more alignment change strategy.<p>

<A NAME=0.2.3></A>
<b>0.2.3 Altars - How to use altars.</b><p>

The main thing done on altars is sacrificing (or 'O'ffering).  Things that can be sacrificed 
include items, monsters and gold.  When sacrificing items, the PC stands on the altar and 
'O'ffers the item, which will then be accepted or rejected by the deity.  When sacrificing 
monsters, the PC stands away from the altar, waits for a monster to step onto the altar, and 
then 'O'ffers it.  Note that most humanoid monsters have the ability to speak.  This means they 
can sacrifice the PC.  Most, but not all, humanoids are chaotic.  So idly standing around on an 
altar, especially a chaotic one, near humanoid enemies is a very unwise thing to do.<p>

When sacrificing items, one might want to keep in mind the fact that some races' deities 
specially favor some item types.  These can be found in the manual and are listed here for 
reference:<p>

Humans: tools of all kind<br>
Trolls: rocks, the larger the better<br>
Hurthlings: cooked meals<br>
Gnomes: gems<br>
Dwarves: gold<br>
High Elves and Gray Elves: magical rings<br>
Dark Elves: magical wands and books<br>
Orcs: melee weapons<br>
Drakelings: musical instruments<p>

Sacrificing monsters can be very bountiful, especially on levels with a high monster generation 
rate.  There are a few things to be remembered, though:<p>

Lawful and neutral gods don't like it when the PC sacrifices "their beings", i.e. neutral beings 
to a neutral god or lawfuls to a lawful god. Chaotics don't care.<p>

Bred, summoned, undead and unlife beings cannot be sacrificed.<p>

On any aligned altar, PCs can detect their items' status by simply dropping it on the 
altar regardless of piety level.  Furthermore, when any offering has been accepted, a message 
will inform the PC of his status with his deity:<p>

"MORTAL, YE HAVE PESTERED ME FOR TOO LONG!" - summons solars/spectres/greater daemons<br>
"Mortal, ye art a pest." A bolt of -damage type- hits you! <br>
"*I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal" - equipment turned to dust<br>
"You feel bad... very bad." - same piety level as above, dooming results if no equipment is present<br>
"Take this for ye impunity!" - inventory cursed<br>
"Mortal, you are a nuisance!"<br>
You hear -deity- grumbling in anger.<br>
For some seconds the ground rumbles. Nothing else happens.<br>
-deity- seems to be unconcerned.<br>
-deity- seems to be pleased.<br>
-deity- seems to be very pleased with you. - deity will bless water dropped on altar<br>
You feel inner strength lifting your spirits. - same piety level as inner peace, deity 
grants the Lucky intrinsic, occurs only if the PC didn't have the Lucky intrinsic<br>
You feel inner peace. - see above message about inner strength<br>
You burn with the anticipation of power - chaotic equivalent of inner peace<br>
You feel spiritually invincible.<br>
You feel very close to -deity- - deity removes Cursed/Doomed intrinsics if present 
("You feel a terrible gloom being lifted from you"), grants Fate Smiles intrinsic<br>
You feel extremely close to -deity- - (pre/post)crowning possibility<br>
-deity- seems to be absolutely close to you - the PC is eligible for crowning: correct alignment and the highest level of piety<p>

Another message occurs only under the following circumstances: if a PC 
sacrifices enough to get to the spiritually invincible state in one turn, 
having neither the Lucky nor Fate Smiles intrinsics, the message "You feel 
spiritually elated!" is generated and the PC receives the Lucky and Fate 
Smiles intrinsics simultaneously.  This works regardless of alignment.  
There may be more details to be worked out concerning this regarding 
possession of the Cursed and/or Doomed intrinsics.<p>

The PC's deity will cure Sickness with any successful sacrifice if piety is high enough.<p>

The equipment turned to dust penalty can be useful as a last resort for getting rid of a stubborn item.  Repeatedly praying will anger a deity to this point.<p>

Other messages are generated when sacrificing under special circumstances 
(generally when the PC has offended his deity):<p>

"*MORTAL, I AM NOT BUILDING A BLOODY GARDEN UP HERE! NO MORE TREES! }*" - the 
PC tried to sacrifice an animated tree; there is a typo, apparently, the }<br>

A voice in your mind lectures you. "*WHAT A MEDIOCRE SIGN OF DEVOTION. IMPROVE!*" 
- the PC tried to sacrifice a summoned creature<br>

A voice in your mind lectures you. "*THOU SHALT TAKE PAINS TO PROVE THY DEVOTION!*"
- the PC tried to sacrifice a spawned creature<br>

You hear a booming voice in your mind...  "*BE WARNED! SACRIFICING MY OWN 
CREATURES IS NOT SOMETHING I WELCOME WITH JOY!*" - the PC tried to sacrifice 
a creature aligned with the altar<br>

-deity- booms: "*YOU DARE TO SACRIFICE MY GIFTS AT MY HOLY PLACE?!?*  "*FOOL!*" 
The -foo- is consumed by a -bar- light and disappears. - the PC sacrificed a 
divine gift<br>

Suddenly -deity- speaks to you.  *YOU DARE TO OFFER THE CRAP SOLD BY RATLING TRADERS?*  
*FORGET IT!*  The -ratling fodder- disappears.<br>

"*FoOl*, ThOsE sErVaNtS aRe MoRe UsEfUl ThAn YoU. wHy NoT sAcRiFiCe YoUrSeLf?" - 
the PC tried to sacrifice an orb guardian<p>

Messages when sacrificing in the dark:<p>

"You feel a warm aura." - a lawful altar<br>
"The air is suddenly very moist." - a neutral altar<br>
"You suddenly feel a chilling cold." - a chaotic altar<p>

These messages are generated regardless of piety. The piety messages follow these. 
Note that creatures cannot be sacrificed in the dark.<p>

Sacrificing items, gold or monsters on an altar can change the alignment of 
the PC or the alignment of the altar.  In general, small sacrifices move the 
alignment of the PC towards the alignment of the altar.  Note, however, that 
sacrificing at a lawful altar will not move a PCs alignment all the way to L+.  
Likewise, sacrificing at a chaotic altar will not move a PCs alignment all the 
way to C-.  To achieve these alignments, the PC has to commit other lawful or 
chaotic acts, respectively (or wear an amulet corresponding to the desired 
alignment, preferably blessed).  Large sacrifices move the alignment of the 
altar towards that of the PC.  Live sacrifices can fall into either category 
depending on the experience level of the PC and the level of the monster being 
sacrificed.  Converting the alignment of a PC or an altar with live sacrifices 
is a somewhat tricky and complicated business and can have dire consequences if 
the sacrificing is done incorrectly.  Using gold is much more straightforward.  
To move a PC's alignment towards that of an altar, sacrifice one gold piece 
repeatedly.  This is just as effective as more gold without the risk of converting 
the altar, described below.  This will eventually result in a message: 
"*WELCOME BELIEVER*" when the PC's alignment changes to that of the altar.  
An additional message, "You feel your morals changing." occurs when changing 
from lawful to neutral on a chaotic altar or from chaotic to neutral on a 
lawful altar.  The exception to this easy alignment conversion is the case of 
highly experienced chaotic PCs.  More about that special case is found in 
section 4.3, ultra endings.  To change the alignment of an altar to match the 
PC's, sacrifice at least 3000 gold at one time.  The 3000 figure is a minimum; 
more may be required depending on the PC's experience level.<p>

Artifacts can be sacrificed and are valuable.  Sacrificing artifacts tied to 
Chaos, such as Moon Sickle and the Crown of Science is a lawful act and will 
move the alignment of the PC.  Beware of this if the PC is close to (pre)crowning.<p>

Some observations about sacrificing on nonaligned altars and changing the 
alignment of altars with live sacrifices:  <p>

Druids should be very careful to avoid sacrificing animals at any time.<p>

Lawful gods do not like having lawful creatures sacrificed; neutral gods do not
like having neutral creatures sacrificed; chaotic gods are indifferent.  This
makes the situation simplest for chaotic PCs.  They can sacrifice anything on 
chaotic altars with no fear of alignment change.  This also means the situation 
is at a dead end: chaotic PC + chaotic altar means no alignment change is 
possible.<p>

Any time a PC sacrifices at a nonaligned altar, <i>two</i> gods are involved: the 
PC's god, who may accept a large enough sacrifice and fight the nonaligned god 
for control of the altar, and the nonaligned god, who may accept small 
sacrifices from the PC and move the PCs alignment towards that of the altar.  
This also means there are two gods who may object to live sacrifices.  It is 
always unwise to sacrifice creatures of the PC's alignment or the altar's 
alignment.  The exception is chaotic PCs sacrificing at chaotic altars as 
described above.<p>

The fact that two deities are involved when sacrificing on a nonaligned altar 
means a puzzling phenomenon may occur when sacrificing the PC's race's god's 
preferred items on a nonaligned altar.  The PC's deity may be able to accept 
the sacrifice and "deeply appreciate" it while simutaneously the nonaligned 
deity is angered by the fact that a nonaligned PC used the altar.  Depending on 
the PC's piety relationship with the nonaligned god (it is possible to have a 
piety relationship with more than one god), this may result in a "deeply 
appreciates" message as well as a negative effect such as inventory cursing 
or destruction.<p>

A live sacrifice at a nonaligned altar behaves similarly to non-live sacrifices 
in that small sacrifices move the PC toward the alignment of the altar while 
large ones move the altar to the PC's alignment, but it is much more difficult 
to predict exactly what will happen.  There are many factors involved: the PC's 
experience level, crowned vs uncrowned status, piety relationship with both the 
PC's god and the nonaligned god as well as the experience level of the monster 
being sacrificed.  A goblin is considered a large sacrifice for a level one PC 
but small for a level ten PC.  It is very difficult to predict exactly what will 
happen in borderline cases.  After reaching experience level five or so, it 
becomes very risky to attempt an altar conversion using a low level live sacrifice 
such as an orc or goblin.  The god's standards are higher than that by this point.<p>

If the PC angers a god by sacrificing one of his creatures, several negative 
consequences may result.  For example, if a PC sacrifices a creature of his own 
alignment his god responds with: "*BE WARNED!  SACRIFICING MY OWN CREATURES IS NOT 
SOMETHING I WELCOME WITH JOY!*"  Repeating this act results in: "*YOU DARE TO 
SACRIFICE ONE OF MY CREATURES?* *DEFILER*"  This may be followed by: "-deity- 
luckily seems unconcerned." depending on the PC's piety level.  Repeating again 
results in the same two messages followed by conversion of a neutral altar to 
chaotic.  This example was done with a neutral PC, exp lvl 5, sacrificing neutrals 
on a neutral altar which became chaotic.  The PC did not gain the cursed or doomed 
intrinsics, nor did his alignment change.<p>

A second example: a chaotic PC sacrificing neutral creatures on a neutral altar:
First: "*YOU DARE TO SACRIFICE ONE OF MY CREATURES?*  *DEFILER*  You suddenly hear 
a thundering voice. *I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal.  Your equipment turns to 
dust."  Next: "*I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal!  You barely notice some 
thoughts: I can't believe it!"  The second message is because the PC was 
wearing artifacts and artifacts only.  The PC did not gain the cursed or doomed 
intrinsics.  If the PC had been wearing any non-artifact equipment, it would have 
been destroyed.  If the PC wore nothing, he gained the doomed, and not the cursed, 
intrinsic.<p>

The implication of the above paragraph should be obvious: Wear <i>artifacts and 
artifacts only</i> when attempting to convert an altar.  Wield a si if necessary.  
This completely avoids the equipment destruction and dooming penalties.<p>

It is not clear exactly what the criteria are for inventory cursing versus 
equipment destruction (turned to dust) versus dooming versus bolts versus summoning.  
Dooming should only occur when the offended god wants to destroy the PC's equipment 
when the PC is wearing no equipment.  Once again, it seems to depend on the PC's 
experience level, crowned vs uncrowned status, general piety level with respect to 
his god and possibly the nonaligned god as well.  There has been a report of 
immediately being blasted with a bolt of True Matter when unsuccessfully attempting 
to convert a neutral altar with a Champion of Law on D: 45, for instance.<p>

The chart below shows all of the possible combinations for PCs sacrificing 
live monsters on aligned and nonaligned altars.  The "altar moves to" field 
<i>assumes the sacrifice is successful</i>.  A dash means there is no change in the 
altar; these are the "proper" sacrifices a PC makes in order to gain piety 
and move towards the extreme of his alignment.  The "god irritated" field is 
as follows: Yes means the PC's god is irritated -  a lawful PC tried to 
sacrifice a lawful creature or a neutral PC tried to sacrifice a neutral 
creature.  No means the sacrifice was proper, the god accepted the sacrifice, 
the PC gains piety and moves closer to the extreme of his alignment.  Fight 
means the original god who owned the altar fights, and loses every time, to 
the god taking possession of it.  Note that the changes are stepwise: a lawful 
PC first changes a chaotic altar to neutral then to lawful.<p>

How the PC's alignment or piety level changes when converting altars is not
proven for all cases.  Note the case of a neutral sacrificing neutrals on a 
neutral altar.  It is correct as written.  The altar moves to chaotic with no 
(or a very, very small) alignment change or other negative consequences to the 
PC.  Also note the remarkable case of neutral PCs sacrificing neutral monsters 
on a chaotic altar.  This converts the altar to neutral with no noticeable 
alignment change.  Lawfuls sacrificing lawfuls on a lawful altar may convert 
the altar to neutral, but not always.  The PC always receives a noticeable 
alignment drop.<p>

This chart will be updated as research progresses.<p>

<p>

Note that only champions of Neutrality or Order can convert the altars in the 
elemental temples.<p>

If all of this has confused more than it has helped, here are some rules of 
thumb:<p>

1) DO NOT sacrifice a creature whose alignment is the same as the PC's or 
   the altar's.  If you need to take advantage of live sacrifices to increase 
   piety, only sacrifice nonaligned monsters on an aligned altar.<p>

2) If you must convert an altar, do it with gold.  It is much, much safer.<p>

<A NAME=0.2.4></A>
<b>0.2.4 Recovering from errors.</b><p>

Precautions:<p>

When converting an altar, remove all gear except for artifacts. Also,
remember that the bigger your sacrifice, the more likely it is that the
altar converts - but remember, this sacrifice probably has minimal effect 
on piety, so don't make it ridiculously huge.<p>

Dropping items on a nonaligned altar will make the deity that owns the 
altar angry.  This causes some warning messages along the lines of "GET 
YOUR JUNK OFF MY ALTAR."  Ordinarily this should be enough warning.  If 
an extended drop command is used, however, there seems to be a bug present 
that allows the dropping to continue until the angry deity curses the 
inventory of the PC.  Watch out for this.<p>


If things go wrong:<p>

1) Inventory cursed<p>

By the time the PC has enough valuable stuff to sacrifice, the PC should be able 
to uncurse a cursed inventory with little trouble.  Get to an aligned altar 
immediately.  Bless your potions of water by dropping them on the altar if 
you are in sufficient standing with your deity.  If not, sacrifice gold 
until you are.  Dip a scroll of uncursing into your new holy water, read it, 
and voila, all of your stuff is back to uncursed status.  Obviously, 
previously blessed status of inventory items has been lost.<p>

2) Equipment turned to dust<p>

This is why it's always recommended to remove non-artifacts before
converting altars - you don't want to lose those seven league boots or
that nifty sword of sharpness, do you?<p>

3) Doomed<p>

If the PC had no equipment, dooming rather than equipment turned to dust will 
occur.  This is why the PC should have <i>some</i> equipment worn, even a si.  It 
will be necessary to sacrifice enough to get your piety all the way up to 
very close, at which time the dooming will be removed.  It is handy to know how 
to remove dooming and cursing in any case, since these intrinsics can be caused 
by things other than mistakes with altars - robbing shops with lawfuls, attacking 
karmics in melee and pools spring to mind.<p>

4) The worst two - bolt and summoning<p>

Ordinarily these never occur when mistakes with altars are made.  It takes 
dooming then repeated additional prayers for a deity to get this mad.  However, 
there are two situations where this will happen <i>immediately</i> - falling from 
champion status and sacrificing a gift from your deity.  The deity casts an 
energy bolt at the PC, which, strangely enough, the PC seems to be immune to 
more often than not.  The deity is further incensed by this and says "DAMN, YOU'LL 
SUFFER FOR THIS HUMILIATION TOO!" and summons creatures dependent on the deity: 
lawful deity - solars, neutral deity - spectres, chaotic diety - greater daemons.  
The exact sequence of events is dependent upon what the PC is doing, praying 
repeatedly while doomed or falling from champion staus.  In the former case there 
may be additional monsters summoned prior to those listed above.<p>

Another case which causes summoning is to get as far as possible from a particular 
god then sacrifice on that god's altar.  For instance, if an initially chaotic PC 
sacrifices repeatedly on a neutral altar to achieve very good standing with the 
neutral god then sacrifices on a lawful altar, creatures may be summoned.<p>

<A NAME=0.2.5></A>
<b>0.2.5 Crowning, precrowning and postcrowning</b><p>

Pre- and postcrowning gives the PC a random artifact, which will be one of the non-guaranteed
artifacts.  The requirements for pre- and postcrowning are:<p>

* precrowning occurs only if the PC is not of extreme alignment (not L+, N= or C-)<br>
* extremely close<br>
* character level >= 8 + 3 × artifacts generated.<p>

Crowning can occur at any experience level.<p>

Postcrowning doesn't include the non-extreme alignment restriction.<p>

Note that PCs who achieve precrowning or crowning may never again see the "extremely close" 
status message.  In this case, determining whether the PC has sufficient piety for further 
precrownings, crowning or postcrowning is a matter of trial and error.  This is not as bad 
as it might seem, since praying uses up very little piety if prayers "remain unheard" - that 
is, the deity does nothing.<p>

These seem to be the most important requirements in 1.0.0 - for instance, the PC may be 
wearing cursed items and the pre- or postcrowning will still occur.<p>

For crowning, the PC must be at extreme alignment and extremely close (or have enough piety 
at very close).    The PC must not be intrinsically Cursed or Doomed for any type of crowning.  
Ordinarily, this will never be a problem, since achieving very close status removes these 
intrinsics.  However, if the PC is wearing or wielding an item that causes Cursing or Dooming 
(the Crown of Science, Executor, etc.), crowning will not occur.  Upon crowning, the PC receives 
an immunity, an artifact crowning gift which is preselected from a list of appropriate items 
for the PC's race and class (see section 0.2.5.1 below), a blessed amulet matching the PC's 
alignment, a permanent blessing, the ability to convert elemental altars for champions of 
Balance and Order, to wear artifacts and other food consumption adding items with less burden 
on metabolism and to pray more often.<p>

Note that the immunity received will not be one the PC already has, whether through eating 
appropriate corpses or worn items.  For instance, if the PC is wearing the Ring of Immunity 
at crowning time, he will receive no immunity at all - take it off!  Likewise, the Ancient 
Mummy Wrapping can be worn or the scorched spear wielded at crowning time to ensure the PC 
does not receive the rather undesirable immunity to cold.<p>

The immunity the PC receives can be figured out by the message that it gives:<p>

Acid:   "You look forward to be digested by Chaos Lords / Lords of Order themselves."<br>
Cold:   "You feel prepared for the most chilling tasks."<br>
Fire:   "You no longer fear the heat of all hells combined."<br>
Shock:  "You feel that neither thunder nor lightning will be able to prevent the
         success of your mission."<p>

Getting pre- or post-crowned increases the piety required for further pre- or post-crownings.<p>

As an example to show how this works quantitatively, Malte Helmert did the following research 
using gold as the sole sacrificial item:<p>

<b>0.2.5.1 Possible crowning gifts for each class</b><p>

Note that Dwarves of any class can receive Hammerhead as a crowning gift.  Likewise, High Elves 
and Gray elves can receive Sun's Messenger as a crowning gift.  This research was last verified 
in gamma 14 by Lee Morgan.  In general, there are six possible gifts.  There are exceptions: see 
Barbarian, Beastfighter, Mindcrafter, Paladin, Thief and Wizard.<p>

Andrew Skalski provided the explanation for this.  By examining 
the g16p2 executable, he determined that there are indeed less than six possible crowning gifts 
for these classes.  However, the blank spots are filled in with a duplicate of one of the 
possibilities.  This means that these classes are twice as likely to receive one of the doubled 
possibilities.  The updated table below now reflects these observations.  The order the artifacts 
are listed in is alphabetical and has no significance.<p>

<b>0.2.6 Piety loss</b><p>

As referred to in the manual, a PC's piety level is determined by the sacrifices made to the PC's god.  
Remember that the value of sacrifices is dependent on a PC's race.  Piety level constantly decreases 
with time, so sacrifices made in the early game will have little effect after many game turns have 
passed.  In practice, this means that a PC who wants to keep his god happy should sacrifice items 
throughout the game.  If a PC wants to be (pre- post- or normally) crowned, he should have a very 
large cache of valuable material to sacrifice.  This can include live sacrifices, of course, which 
are always valuable.<p>
