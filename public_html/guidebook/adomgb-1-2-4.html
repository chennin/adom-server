<H3>The Infinite Dungeon - beginning</H3>

More about the Infinite Dungeon (ID) can be found in section 2.25.  Here we are 
concerned only with the start of the game.<p>


<b>1.2.4.1 Why start the game in the Infinite Dungeon?</b><p>

Starting the game in the ID is a very conservative approach for PCs that are weak at 
the start of the game.  Given the significance of the first kill, it is probably not 
advisable to make the first kill in the ID, but gaining further experience while 
staying on level one of the ID is about as safe as things get in ADOM.  The PC can 
flee from anything threatening, such as dark rooms or tension rooms, by exiting the 
ID and reentering.  This strategy is one way to get difficult classes to experience 
level five or so before the ID becomes intolerably tedious.<p>
