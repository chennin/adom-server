<H3>What's next?</H3>

After exploring the area around Terinyo, the next step is to undertake a trek through the 
wilderness to the main dungeon in the game, the Caverns of Chaos (CoC).  If the PC chose 
Rynt's quest, Rynt will provide some advice about finding the CoC.  Remember to take enough 
food to survive the trip through the wilderness!  If the PC chose to descend through the 
Unremarkable Dungeon, he is already quite close to the entrance of the CoC, which is found 
in the western central part of the wilderness map.<p>
