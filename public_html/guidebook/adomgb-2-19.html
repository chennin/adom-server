The Tower of Eternal Flames, found in the Wilderness, is probably the nastiest place in 
the game given the experience level of PCs who must visit it. The layout of the Fire 
Temple itself, found on the uppermost of four levels, on the right side of the level, is 
as follows:<p>

The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging.  Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the underscore 
in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is 
found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. 
The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC instantly should he 
step on it. In addition, they can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which 
means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before receieving 
Gaab'Baay's first quest. The monsters in the Fire Temple are arrayed as follows:<p>

PCs are denied entrance to the lower CoC until they have the Chaos Orb of Elemental 
Fire, held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm in the ToEF, and the game stalls at this point.  
PCs can continue to gain experience levels by staying on available cavernous levels 
(for instance) in order to have a better chance in the Tower.  Ultimately, however, 
boredom will set in and the PC will have to face the Tower.  Obtaining the Fire 
Orb is a huge hurdle to get over and marks a division between the earlier, 
beginning parts of the game and the latter parts of the game.  Some players 
also believe it marks the division between beginning and advanced players.<p>

The Tower of Eternal Flames consists of four levels.  They are all very, very 
hot.  This causes damage to both the PC and his equipment, whether worn or in 
the pack.  To protect the PC, fire resistance or immunity is necessary.  See 
section 0.12.1 about fire resistance.<p>

To protect the PC (other than drakelings, see below) completely from the heat 
in the ToEF, the PC must have four sources of fire resistance.  Note that 
intrinsic fire resistance counts as two sources.  Thus, for example, a PC with 
intrinsic fire resistance wearing a ring of fire resistance under the elemental 
gauntlets would take no damage from the heat in the Tower.<p>

There are a number of artifacts that grant fire resistance or immunity.  Guaranteed 
examples include the elemental gauntlets, the black torc (curses), the Ring of the 
High Kings (all grant resistance), the Shield of Raw Steel (immunity, but corrupts) 
and the Crown of Science (immunity, but also dooms and curses). There is a game bug 
which causes fireproof blankets to be positively affected by the cursed and doomed 
intrinsics; they seem to last indefinitely in the Tower. Assaulting the Tower with 
these intrinsics is a dangerous choice, of course. It is difficult enough without 
them. There are several other nonguaranteed artifacts which grant resistance or 
immunity to fire. It is worth remembering that artifacts are indestructible and 
so cannot be damaged by the heat in the Tower.<p>

Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF.  The Mad Minstrel sings a song 
about this.  Drakelings, even those with fire immunity, always take damage in 
the ToEF.  This is not because of the heat itself but is a secondary effect due 
to the greatly increased metabolism drakelings will suffer from in the ToEF.  
There is no way around it.  In order to survive, drakelings must have a means 
of regeneration or healing in the ToEF.  Ideally an artifact that causes 
regeneration should be worn.  An alternative is to bring blessed potions of 
extra healing along.  It is possible for drakelings to do the ToEF with only 
three or four blessed PoEH if everything is done efficiently with no wasted 
time.<p>

One technique drakelings (and other races for that matter) can use is to read a 
blessed scroll of magic mapping upon entering a new level of the ToEF followed 
by teleportation to the up stairway.  Obviously the PC must have the necessary 
scrolls, wands or spell and teleport control.<p>

The heat in the tower will destroy equipment that is vulnerable to fire.  
This includes most items that are not made of the higher metals mithril, 
adamantium and eternium. Rings of fire resistance will not be damaged. Weapons 
and armor with the red prefix are also impervious to heat.<p>

If a PC must wear items vulnerable to fire, a blessed ring of ice is necessary, 
which will also protect items in the pack.  Uncursed rings of ice will not work, 
they must be blessed.  Even with a blessed ring of ice, some equipment destruction 
may occur.  Blessed rings of ice seem to protect to the 92-95% level.  Even 
wearing two blessed rings of ice does not guarantee worn equipment will not be 
destroyed, although the protection seems to go up to 99+%.  A ring of ice is of 
course not necessary if the PC wears only artifacts and items made of the higher 
metals.  Missiles are an obvious problem.  It is rare to find enough arrows made 
from higher metals to satisfy an archer in the ToEF.  Even rocks are vulnerable 
to the heat, sometimes exploding.  Non-artifact slings, bows and crossbows are 
liable to be burnt or melted.<p>

This whole situation is very vexing, because the ToEF contains a very nasty 
collection of monsters and the PC naturally wants to bring his best equipment 
with him, but at the same time does not want it destroyed.<p>

One thing to remember - rings are never destroyed until the gauntlets worn over 
them are destroyed.  Since the artifact elemental gauntlets are available to all 
PCs, this provides a foolproof means of protecting nonartifact rings.<p>

The objective in the ToEF is of course the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire.  It is 
held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm who can be found on the top level of the ToEF.  
This level is typical of the levels containing elemental temples.  The temple 
itself occupies half of the level and is disconnected.  It can only be reached 
by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level.  Since a PC may have his 
only means of digging destroyed on his way through the tower, praying on the top 
level will result in a pickaxe gift from the PC's god. The piety level required 
is high, probably very close. The PC must not be doomed or cursed. If he is using 
artifacts that grant those intrinsics, remove them.<p>

The temple itself is occupied by problematic monsters. These include fire 
elementals, chaos servants, fire grues, fire drakes and fire demons in addition 
to the orb guardian. The fire demons and fire grues in particular are annoying 
because they have a corrupting melee attack with a very high to-hit.  Even PCs 
with excellent DV will be hit eventually. Taken as a whole, this means that 
invisibility is very, very desirable in the Fire Temple.<p>

The only temple monsters that see in Darkness are fire demons and the Ancient 
Chaos Wyrm. It is most useful for fighting the elementals. It is probably wise 
to dispel the Darkness before tackling the ACW.<p>


<b>2.19.1 The Ancient Chaos Wyrm</b><p>

The Ancient Chaos Wyrm holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, the key to the 
lower parts of the CoC.  It has a rarely used fire breath attack which is almost 
irrelevant given the environment and a corrupting melee attack.  In addition it 
is able to cast confusion and an energy ray. The energy ray is a straight line 
bolt spell with a range of thirteen squares. This means standing out of line and 
attacking with missiles or bouncing bolts is very effective. The ACW will not 
cast energy ray through any other monsters. It will kill monsters summoned by 
the PC. The confusion attack can occur any time the PC is in the ACW's line of 
sight. It is able to heal its wounds. The ACW can be killed in a variety of ways 
including brute force, although it is preferable to attack it from a distance due 
to its corrupting melee attack. The ACW is vulnerable to demon and dragon 
slayers. It can be disabled by thrown potions, stun rays and paralyzation. 
Thrown potions of cure corruption damage it. If it is killed on the temple's 
altar, be extraordinarily careful!  If the PC is visible the fire demons will 
sacrifice him instantly.  Even if the PC is invisible, fire demons who have been 
engaged in melee will "know" where the PC is and sacrifice him.  The safest thing 
to do is kick anything dropped on the altar to an adjacent square before picking 
it up. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, 
which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, 
before retrieving the Medal of Chaos.<p>

An examination of the Ancient Chaos Wyrm with a blessed stethoscope reveals:<p>

You examine the Ancient Chaos Wyrm. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 20, Hits:
209, Attacks: 3, Damage: 15-51. Speed: 98.<p>

This speed is probably not typical. Values around 130 are more common.<p>
