<H3>Dungeon features</H3>

Thanks to gut for the following observations:<p>

Dungeon generation has a few peculiarities that may be worth mentioning.
Almost all rooms generated on any level will have an odd number of floor
spaces available. To my knowledge, the only exception to this is the very
rare random shop room. They are capable of being generated with an even
number of available floor spaces, and this causes the 'dig' algorithm in the
game to be unable to connect them to the rest of the map. The only way
to reach these shops is by tunneling.<p>

Remarks about staircase generation and room layout:<p>


When hopping in the ID, I noticed that some rooms were likely to have staircases in the adjacent room. Basically, if you enter a room that's <i>in</i> a corner, or <i>near</i> a corner, and your room has a door that leads <i>directly</i> up, down, left or right, into a corner, there is likely a stair room there.<p> 

For example, if a room like this:<p>
<pre>
   #########                 
   #.......#                 
   #.<.....#                 
   #.......#                 
   #####.###                 
       #+#   
</pre>
is generated at the top of the level, at the left or right-hand corners, it likely leads to a stair room.<p>

Please note that this:<p>
<pre>
   #########                 
   #.......#            
   #.<.....###                 
   #.........#               
   #########.#               
           #.#
           #.#
           ..#
</pre>
isn't the same, and will not work.<p>

One like this:<p>
<pre>
      #+#   
   ####.####                 
   #.......#                 
   #.<.....#                 
   #.......#                 
   #########                 
</pre>
at the bottom left or right-hand corners is good too.<p>


A room like this:<p>
<pre>
 #######                           
 #.....##                   
 #.<....+                    
 #.....##                     
 #######                            
</pre>                         
has a high probability if it is generated at the right-hand side of the map, but it has to be at the very top or bottom, right next to a corner.<p>

The same goes for a room like this:<p>
<pre>
 #######                           
##.....#                   
+....<.#                    
##.....#                     
 #######       
</pre>
in the left hand side of the level.<p>

A room like this :<p>
<pre>
 #######                           
##.....###                   
.....<....                    
##.....###                     
 #######       
</pre>
is also good if next to any corner, but doesn't seem as sure as the others.<p>

"You feel a great wave of relief rushing through these tunnels." - Jharod has healed Yrrigs while both are out of LOS<br>
"Jharod, the healer, suddenly seems to touch someone in a soothing way. You feel a great wave of relief rushing towards you." - Jharod, in LOS, has healed Yrrigs, out of LOS<br>
"You suddenly feel ancient magical energies manifest in your vicinity." - the PC has just achieved experience level 13; the papyrus scroll has been generated, which is an invitation to enter the Pyramid (see section 2.9).  Alternatively:<br>

"Your -foo- starts to rot!" - a food item in the PC's pack has started to rot(which means it has changed from uncursed to cursed status)<br>
"Your -foo- rots away!" - a (cursed) food item in the PC's pack has rotted away; the difference between this message and "Your equipment suddenly seems to weigh less." may be Perception dependent or may involve other factors<br>

"You smash the stones to pieces. Some stuff buried in the rock in uncovered!" - the PC dug through stone, uncovering an item dropped by a monster that was killed while in the wall<br>
"The altar is smashed by the greater moloch! An energy bolt strikes down on the greater moloch! The greater moloch shruggs it off and laughs with malicious glee!" - pretty self-explanatory<br>
"*SORRY, MISSED*" - the above happens, but the PC is doomed; the god strikes at the PC by mistake<br>
"You hit something and notice a thudding sound." - the PC killed an invisible monster with a missile<br>
"Drops of blood appear on the ground." - an invisible monster is bleeding<p>


<A NAME=0.13.2></A><b>0.13.2 Traps</b><p>

Traps are exactly what the name implies.  They are represented by carets ^ in the dungeon maps once they are discovered.  There are several varieties which do various nasty things to the PC or his worn or carried inventory:<p>
<table border=1>
<th>Trap</th><th>Caret symbol</th><th>Effect</th>
<tr><td>Acid<td>green<td>damages or destroys non-artifact worn equipment
<tr><td>Alarm<td>orange<td>warns every monster on the level of the PC's presence and causes them to become hostile
<tr><td>Arrow<td>white<td>shoots an arrow at the PC; can be exploited to gain arrows
<tr><td>Ceiling<td>dark blue<td>drops a portion of the ceiling on the PC; only found in the mana temple
<tr><td>Corruption<td>purple<td>corrupts the PC; a relatively small effect
<tr><td>Explosion<td>red<td>generates a fireball at the location of the trap
<tr><td>Light<td>yellow<td>blinds the PC
<tr><td>Pit<td>brown or cyan<td>PC falls into a hole; can be used to train Climbing; two types, one contains vipers; appear as cyan caret if detected with a wand of trap detection, brown caret if detected with the Detect Traps skill (this may well be a bug)
<tr><td>Spear<td>brown<td>shoots a spear at the PC; can be exploited as a source of metal
<tr><td>Stone block<td>gray<td>drops a stone block on the PC; can kill low level PCs
<tr><td>Teleportation<td>light green<td>teleports the PC; sometimes handy for on-demand teleportation
<tr><td>Water<td>blue<td>causes a gush of water; can destroy scrolls if the PC does not have a waterproof blanket to protect the backpack; rusts vulnerable armor and weapons
</table>
<p>
Traps can be deliberately set off by standing on the trap and pressing ctrl-T.<p>

It should be noted that traps affect monsters as well as the PC: light traps will blind monsters,
corruption traps will corrupt monsters, acid traps will damage monsters, etc.  An interesting use
for an alarm trap is to lure a monster across it.  Other monsters will become hostile towards the
monster which triggered the trap and attack it.  This can be very handy for disposing of cats (see
section 0.9.2).<p>

Traps can be discovered with the Detect Traps skill.  PCs with this skill automatically apply
it when the 's'earch command is used.  In ordinary dungeons it is not worth using this technique,
but in heavily trapped areas (the underground level of the Dwarven Graveyard, the Pyramid,
certain elemental temples) it is definitely prudent to use this skill multiple times during every
turn where the PC suspects a trap is present.<p>

Traps are much easier to avoid once they are discovered, probably by a factor of 100 or more.
This is why the Detect Traps skill is so useful.  Every PC should attempt to gain this skill.
Wands of trap detection can be used for this, but they run out of charges.  They can be recharged of
course, but the skill never runs out and is unaffected by the mana battery corruption.<p>

Traps occur in a known pattern.  The order, left to right or top to bottom, is:<p>

Light trap<br>
Corruption trap<br>
Stone block trap<br>
Alarm<br>
Arrow trap<br>
Acid trap<br>
Pit - this pit is distinct from the other in that it contains vipers<br>
Spear trap<br>
Teleportation trap<br>
Water trap<br>
Fireball trap<br>
Pit - simple pit, no vipers<p>

There are several places on fixed-layout levels where trap types and locations are shown in
these documents.  Note that trap <i>types</i>, in particular, are dependent upon the dungeon level
where the fixed-layout level in question is generated.  Examples include Dwarftown and (most of)
the elemental temples.  There is generally a warning in those sections concerning variations
caused by differing dungeon level.  There is also variability introduced if the player chooses
to play with nonstandard resolution.  There is no warning about this factor.  Nevertheless, the
above pattern applies; identifying a single trap allows the player to predict the type of trap
generated elsewhere on the level.<p>

Finally, bear in mind that PCs with high Alertness, Perception and Dexterity stats will avoid
undiscovered traps much more successfully than those without these abilities.<p>

Note that it is not possible to use the 'w5' (walk in place) command while standing on a trap.<p>

<A NAME=0.13.3></A><b>0.13.3 Doors</b><p>

There are doors on many of the dungeon room entrances.  The majority of doors are not a problem.
However, they can be locked or locked and trapped.<p>

<b>0.13.3.1 Locked doors</b><p>

Locked doors can be opened using several methods.  The most obvious is with a key that fits the
lock.  Keys are randomly found in the dungeons.  Skriek, the ratling in Lawenilothehl, also sells
keys.  Blessed keys will generally open a locked door without setting off a trap if one is present.
A message is generated: "You notice a clicking sound." meaning a trap was bypassed.  Cursed keys
will often break when used, setting off a trap in the process, if one is present.  Doors can be
kicked down; this will set off a trap every time if one is present.  An unsuccessful attempt to
kick down a non-trapped door yields the message "You kick the door but it does not budge." An
unsuccessful attempt to kick down a trapped door yields the message "You kick the door but it does
not budge at all."  In this case the PC was extremely lucky, since kicking a trapped door almost
invariably sets off the trap. Huge rocks or anvils can be thrown at doors to smash them.  Doors can
be tunneled around with a pickaxe.  The safest way to open a door is with the Knock spell or a wand
of knocking.  A magical breeze blows the door open and traps are completely bypassed.<p>

As with traps, door locks occur in a known pattern.  The order, left to right or top to bottom, is:<p>

Tiny lock<br>
Square lock<br>
Round lock<br>
Triangular lock<br>
Hexagonal lock<br>
Small lock<p>

<b>0.13.3.2 Door traps</b><p>

There are different types of door traps:<p>
<table border=1>
<th>Trap</th><th>Effect</th>
<tr><td>Collapsing door<td>drops door directly in front of doorway, damages the PC and worn equipment
<tr><td>Explosive rune<td>arguably the worst door trap, destroys a variety of worn items and backpack items and damages the PC; a new effect in ADOM 1.1.x+ is possible deafening of the PC
<tr><td>Fireball trap<td>similar to the explosion trap, generates a fireball, can injure companions, making them become hostile
<tr><td>Flash<td>blinds the PC temporarily, also can stun the PC - might be two different types of traps
<tr><td>Trick door<td>similar to the stone block trap, drops stones directly in front of the door, can kill low level PCs
</table>
<p>
Players should get into the habit of never standing directly in front of a door when opening it
whenever possible.  This will completely eliminate deaths from trick door traps and damage from
collapsing doors.  It also lessens the damage from an explosive rune: "You partially evade the
explosion."  As with ordinary traps, PCs with high Dexterity are more successful at evading door
traps: "Suddenly a huge rock drops directly in front of the door!  You barely evade it by jumping
backwards!"<p>

If the PC has the Detect Traps skill, it is worth 'a'pplying it a few times in the direction of
closed doors.<p>

<b>0.13.3.3 Secret doors</b><p>

Some doors are hidden and must be 's'earched for.  A ring of searching will do this automatically.
Alternatively, secret doors may be discovered by 'k'icking them.  Kicking a normal dungeon wall results
in the message "You hurt your foot kicking the wall!".  Kicking a concealed secret door results in the
message "You really hurt your foot kicking the wall!"<p>


<A NAME=0.13.4></A><b>0.13.4 Dark rooms</b><p>

Dark rooms, and dark areas in general, are just that - dark.  They are problematic since approaching
enemies can't be seen.  It is also possible to inadvertantly kill a creature in a dark room.  The
darkness can be permanently dispelled with the Light spell or a wand of light.  A torch or an amulet
of light provides a temporary light source.  If a doomed PC enters a dark room, there is a 1 in 1000
chance of being instakilled by a grue each turn.<p>


<A NAME=0.13.5></A><b>0.13.5 Tension rooms, threatening rooms</b><p>

Tension rooms are relatively small rooms filled with monsters.  They always have doors that cause
the walls around them to crumble.  This allows the monsters within to swarm the PC.  They can be
filled with monsters of one type, two separate types or a variety of different monsters.  Mixed
tension rooms in particular can contain out-of-depth monsters.  Since the level message "You sense
a certain tension." is always associated with these rooms, the PC is forewarned.  It is prudent
to find out what is in the tension room with a wand of monster detection, especially at deeper
dungeon levels.  It is quite possible to be faced with a ghost king and ancient karmic dragon
simultaneously from such a room.<p>

A new variant of tension rooms has appeared in ADOM 1.0.0+.  The level message "You feel threatened."
is generated on levels containing these rooms.  These rooms are similar to tension rooms, but are always
filled with a single type of monster. In addition, they do not have the crumbling walls feature of
tension rooms.<p>


<A NAME=0.13.6></A><b>0.13.6 Herbs</b><p>

Herb bushes are always found in the Big Room (level 6 of the Caverns of Chaos) and randomly
elsewhere in the dungeons.  They grow according to Conway's Life rules.  They are as follows:<p>

If the bush has 0 or 1 neighboring bush, it will die in the next generation<br>
If the bush has 2 or 3 neighboring bushes, it will survive through the next generation<br>
If the bush has 4 neighboring bushes, it will die in the next generation<br>
If an empty dungeon square has 3 neighboring bushes, a new bush will grow during the next generation<br>
Births and deaths are simultaneous<p>

ADOM adds to this: if a bush has two neighbors, it will remain the same during the next generation.
If a bush has three neighbors, it will generate more blossoms during the next generation.  These
additions are important, since there are many stable patterns, but very few that will continue to
blossom over time.  For instance the following patterns are stable:<p>
<pre>
                                       *     *
                                      * *   * *
                                      * *    *
                                       *
</pre>
but are quite useless as far as ADOM is concerned.  Since none of the bushes has three neighbors,
once they reach a withered state they will never recover.  The best pattern to create for farming
herbs in ADOM is a 2 × 2 square of herbs.  This will remain alive indefinitely and generate more
herb blossoms every generation.  It is also worth preserving a 1 × 3 pattern.  This is a pattern
that oscillates between horizontal and vertical.  Since two of the herb bushes are new each
generation and therefore unpicked, they will constantly be renewed.  The danger with this pattern
is overharvesting.  If one bush dies, they all die.  The square 2 × 2 pattern does not have this
liability.  If one (and only one) bush dies, it will be filled in the next generation.<p>

Herbs apparently require light to survive.  A message "It's dark here! Some herb bushes full of
blossoms are growing here. The vegetation beneath your feet shrivels and suddenly is gone." has
been observed.<p>

Herbs have the following properties:<p>
<table border=1>
<th>Name</th><th>Method of use</th><th>Cursed effect</th><th>Uncursed effect</th><th>Blessed effect</th>
<tr><td>stomafillia<td>eat<td>satiates less<td>satiates<td>bloats
<tr><td>stomacemptia<td>eat<td>near starvation<td>makes hungry!<td>makes almost hungry
<tr><td>curaria mancox<td>eat<td>smaller effect<td>fights sickness<td>cures sickness
<tr><td>devil's rose<td>eat<td>severe sickness<td>sickness<td>mild sickness
<tr><td>alraunia antidote<td>eat<td>smaller effect<td>dilutes poisoning<td>cures most poisoning
<tr><td>demon daisy<td>eat<td>severely poisons<td>poisons<td>mildly poisons
<tr><td>pepper petal<td>eat<td>smaller effect<td>heals a little<td>heals more (~27 points)
<tr><td>burb root<td>eat<td>more damage<td>burns stomach damage<td>less damage
<tr><td>morgia root<td>eat<td>exercises Wi & To<td>exercises Wi & To<td>really exercises Wi & To
<tr><td>spenseweed<td>use<td>smaller effect<td>heals a little<td>heals more (~30 points)
<tr><td>moss of mareilon<td>use<td>abuses Dx<td>exercises Dx<td>really exercises Dx
</table>
<p>

Note that eating many devil's roses does not increase the duration of sickness, but instead increases 
the damage from the final blow sickness delivers. This can be over 1000 HPs. This is important for those 
exploiting the temporary stat-draining properties of sickness to increase stats.<p>

See section 0.6.1.3 for more on training stats with herbs.<p>

Herbs can be generated on any dungeon level by 'U'sing a potion of holy water on a dungeon
square, even for PCs without the Gardening skill.  The success rate is about 33%.  Note that
while any dungeon level will work, only those levels which already had herbs will support
herb growth.  In other words, herbs will not undergo the normal growth cycle unless the
dungeon level had indigenous herbs.  Consequently, the PC should avoid creating herbs in this
manner unless the dungeon level already has herbs, unless it is a matter of life or death.  The
exception is PCs that have the Gardening skill. 'A'pplying the Gardening skill with herb seeds causes a dungeon level to transform to an herb-sustaining state. Be sure to take advantage of the information below about creating especially desirable herbs.<p>

Note when planting or rearranging herbs that they will not grow on a square that contains a spider's web.<p>

Reproduced here is a -----short treatise on herbs by the newsgroup poster known as Loves A Dustbin-----:<p>

The patterns governing herb growth are well documented elsewhere, but it is
also quite easy to tell what kind of herb a given bush will produce.  How?
It's determined by the line on the screen at which the bush appears.  Using the
big room as a guide, the first screen line at which a floor or dungeon feature
can appear is line 5, whose herb bushes always produce morgia roots.  The line
below that is home to moss of mareilon, and below that is the mighty
spenseweed.  Curaria mancox/devil's roses are next, followed by alraunia
antidote/demon daisy, followed by stomafillia/stomacemptia, followed by pepper
petal/burb root.  The line after pepper petal is morgia root again, and the
pattern repeats.  Presented more visually (and best viewed in a monospaced
font):<pre>
(line no.
  mod 7)  type of herb found at that line

    4    | pepper petal/burb root</pre>

If you don't know what "line number mod 7" means in the above chart, feel free
to ignore it.  Just remember that the pattern starts with morgia root for the
topmost line at which herb bushes usually appear (barring any digging) and
repeat every seven lines.  BTW, if you are like me in never remembering which
beneficial herbs are paired with demon daisies and devil's roses, remember the
"a" in "daisy" matches the "a"'s in "alraunia" and the "o" in "rose" matches
the "o" in "mancox."  Kinda cheesy, but it works.<p>

On a standard 80x25 character screen, there are fifteen lines on which floors
and dungeon features may appear, yielding two complete repetitions of the
pattern with a bonus line of morgia root at the bottom.  Lines 4, 20, and 21
may be burrowed to yield floors there too, and herb bushes can grow into these
lines once dug out if their growth patterns permit it.  If you play on a larger
screen, use the "l"ook command to count down the line number of a given herb
bush, keeping in mind that the "look" cursor's topmost limit is line 3, which
would be stomafillia according to the pattern.<p>

It is sometimes possible to move herb bushes to the lines you want in order to
get a particularly desirable herb.  You need four herb bushes in a "T" shape,
like this (again, view it in a monospaced font):<pre>
...
"""
.".</pre>

When it's time for new bushes to grow, you'll get this pattern . . .<pre>

.".
"""
"""</pre>

. . . pick the bottom row clean . . .<pre>

.".
"""
...</pre>

. . . and wait for another generation to pass . . .<pre>

"""
"""
.".</pre>

Then harvest the bottom bush of each column to oblivion.<pre>

"""
.".
...</pre><p>

Voila!  The T has moved up a row.  You can also use an inverted T to move
downward, or T's laid on their sides to move left or right.  Once your T is in
the position you want, just pluck off one end of the crossbar to get the
ever-lovin' herb square.  The process isn't risk-free, however.  For one thing,
generations of herb growth are not always predictable, and you may find two
generations spawning in quick succession without giving you enough time in
between to overharvest the needed bushes.  Another note:  do this in a locked
room if you can.  If you don't, the RNG <i>will</i> dump a wererat or a dark elven
spider factory into your lap at an inoppurtune moment, leaving you to hack and
slash through the bodies and miss perhaps several generations of herb growth.<p>

As for the overall usefulness of each herb--well, reasonable minds will differ.
Following are my own subjective opinions.  Spenseweed, stomafillia, morgia root
and moss of mareilon are the top four, with a definite gap in usefulness
between them and curaria and alraunia, and another larger gap between those two
and pepper petal.  I personally rate spenseweed and stomafillia at the top
because their utility never expires; you will <i>always</i> need healing and you
will <i>always</i> need food, but the stat gain twins stop increasing your stats at
a certain point.  My non-troll characters go for spenseweed first, stomafillia
second; for trolls, the priorities are reversed.  If only the two grew on
adjacent lines!  Also, don't pass up the opportunity for a stat gain square,
ever, unless you absolutely must choose between morgia root and spenseweed.
Even then, morgia root <i>may</i> be the right choice, depending on how early it is
(early game, pick morgia, late, pick spenseweed, middle is a toss-up), your
race and class (mindcrafters and wizards love morgia, brawlers <i>need</i>
spenseweed), and how low your stats are now.<p>

In the middle tier, I prefer alraunia antidote in the <i>very</i> early game, as in
the initial dive from the SMC to the mountain village before my first spider
corpse.  Once I'm no longer scared of pit vipers, my preference changes to
curaria mancox so as to safely increase my Mana score by munching on kobold
shaman.  Last and in my mind least is pepper petal, which is inferior to
spenseweed in almost every way.  Spenseweed's use by rubbing instead of
ingesting allows its use even while bloated, which will happen often if you're
on the Blessed stomafillia Diet Plan (TM).  Pepper petal has an evil twin;
spenseweed doesn't.  I've not observed any significant difference in healing
potency between blessed pepper petal and blessed spenseweed, but as I often
don't even bother to ID a bush I know will be pepper petal, I may have missed
it.  Some may argue that pepper petal is preferable to spenseweed for a
starving character, but since stomafillia grows on the line above pepper
petal--i.e. the two are often found together--I don't consider that a
compelling argument.<p>

Please note that, in those crucial beginning turns, <i>any</i> beneficial herb
(anything but the "evil twins") can save your life.  If you see an herb bush by
its lonesome, fated to die next generation anyway, then for heaven's sake,
don't stop picking till you see the ground!  Also, the Alchemy skill can add
new wrinkles to prioritizing one's herbs.  If you happen to know a recipe for a
PoGA using only demon daisies and booze, then ignore the above paragraphs and
GO FOR IT, MAN!  Remember that success in the Drakalor Chain often comes not by
memorizing a bunch of rules and patterns but by thinking on your feet!<p>

Generation of the r pentomino - thanks to Malte Helmert for the method<p>

It is almost inevitable for a stable square herb pattern to form spontaneously.
Alternatively, one can be generated.  Once a square is generated, the PC needs
to generate only one additional bush to form the r pentomino pattern, which grows
explosively.  Follow the steps shown below:<p>

<pre>
 . = empty, no change  1) ........ 2) ........ 3) ........ 4) ........ 5) ........ 6) ........
 o = alive, boring        ........    ........    ..+.....    ..kn....    ...o....    ...o....
 + = added by you         ...oo...    ...oo...    ...oo...    ..noo...    ..ooo...    ..ooo...
 - = killed by you        ...oo...    ...o-...    ...o....    ...on...    ...-o...    ....o...
 n = generated by rules   ........    ........    ........    ........    ........    ........
 k = killed by rules      ........    ........    ........    ........    ........    ........
</pre>
This pattern will then grow for dozens of generations.<p>

<A NAME=0.13.7></A><b>0.13.7 Shops</b><p>

Shops are rooms in the dungeons inhabited by shopkeepers and stocked with their wares.  Shops can be
general stores selling a variety of items or specialty stores selling only one type of item.  Shops
should always be entered and explored, since viewing the items in a shop permanently identifies them.
There are guaranteed shops in the game: Munxip's food store in Terinyo, Barnabas' shop in Lawenilothehl,
Waldenbrook's shop in Dwarftown, Leggot's shop in the High Mountain Village and the Great Gift Shoppe
in the Casino.  Others are found randomly in the dungeons.  Shopkeepers generally buy items as well as
selling them.  The exception is the Casino shop, which only sells.  Specialty storekeepers are only
interested in purchasing the items they specialize in.  Sell Munxip those useless kobold corpses!<p>

Shopkeepers will restock their inventory if it is depleted or appears to be depleted.  It is a good idea
to pick up everything in a shop and drop the unwanted items on one square.  This gives the shopkeeper
room to restock.  Note that it is necessary  for a certain amount of game time to pass in order for a
shop to restock.  PCs with sufficient Perception scores and Listening skill levels will hear a message
"You hear arcane mumbling." which means a depleted shop has been restocked.<p>

Shopkeepers have definite racial prejudices in addition to the special criteria Munxip (see sections
1.2.1.2, 1.2.1.3) and Barnabas (see sections 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2) use. Malte Helmert has done some testing
regarding this and observed the following: The HMV and Lawenilothehl shops were generated 50 times each.
The races of the shopkeepers were:<p>

Barnabas: 15 × Human, 14 × Orc, 13 × Troll, 8 × Gnome<br>
Leggot: 18 × Human, 14 × Troll, 9 × Gnome, 9 × Dwarf<p>

Other races may be possible, with a very low probability.<p>

Quoting Malte's findings:<p>

"The following chart lists the percentage of the "base value" offered by a shopkeeper of the race
specified in the column to a PC of the race specified in the row. 100% is normal, 110% is possible
if the shopkeeper likes the PC's race very much (mostly if both are of the same race), and the value
can become as low as 10% if the shopkeeper really hates the PC's race.<p>

"Looking at the chart, you see that all non-Hurthling shopkeepers prefer PCs of the same race.
Hurthlings are the only shopkeeper race that isn't prejudiced, and Hurthlings are also the
best-liked PC race (there is no race that gives Hurthlings a really bad deal, and many give them
excellent deals).<p>

"Considering the fact that the most important shopkeeper in the game is a Dwarf [Waldenbrook - AW],
Orcish and especially Dark Elven PCs appear to have the worst time (this is not news, of course)."<p>

Shops can be robbed.  This of course has effects on alignment, in addition to putting the PC's life at
risk.  These shopkeepers are maintaining a business in a highly dangerous enviroment and are well
suited to dealing with those who choose to steal from them.  In addition to their own very tough nature,
they can summon hordes of thugs who attack the PC.  Shopkeepers are able to detect invisible PCs.  The
message "-Shopkeeper- stares at your position with great intensity." indicates they have detected and
are looking at an invisible PC.  However, this does not happen instantly.  Therefore, invisibility can
be used to rob shops without making the shopkeeper hostile.  The PC can enter a shop while invisible and
pick up items.  Anything the invisible PC picks up <i>prior</i> to generation of the above message can be
taken from the shop safely.  Therefore, the usual technique is to enter the shop while visible, gather
up everything in the shop and drop it all as close to the door as possible.  The PC can then become
invisible, pick up everything and leave the shop undetected as long as the above message is not generated.<p>

Another technique for robbing shops is available for those PCs who have pets or slaves under good control.
If a shop is entered and nothing is picked up, the shopkeeper does not block the door.  The PC can order
his pet or slave to stand in the doorway, pick up whatever is desired, then :s swap positions with the
pet or slave.  At that point, getting away with the loot is simply a matter of outrunning the shopkeeper
and avoiding or killing any summoned thugs.<p>

A PC with the Teleportation spell can teleport a shopkeeper out of his shop.  Shopkeepers are
teleportation resistant, so trying this with a wand is usually not successful and a waste of the wand's
charges.  This results in a hostile shopkeeper and summoned thugs, however.  Since it is impossible to
choose the destination of the shopkeeper, this is a dangerous technique unless the PC is experienced
enough to deal with a hostile shopkeeper and the thugs he will summon.<p>

A hostile shopkeeper can use his thrown coin attack only once.<p>

<A NAME=0.13.8></A><b>0.13.8 Rivers</b><p>

Introduced in gamma 14, these can be found in the High Kings cave, puppy cave, druid dungeon, CoC, ID, UD
(Rift?). Like any body of water, they can rust unprotected iron items, drench scrolls and spellbooks
and drown the PC. Drowning damage seems to be dependent on HPs, with high-HP PCs taking proportionally 
<i>more</i> damage. Precautions include waterproof blankets, a high Swimming skill, water breathing gear
(see section 0.12.7), rustproofing iron items and freezing the water.<p>


<A NAME=0.13.9></A><b>0.13.9 Pools</b><p>

Drinking from pools can do various magical things to a PC: one can gain or lose <i>any</i> intrinsic or
unnatural aging.  It is very possible to be corrupted by drinking from pools.  Also, hostile snakes or
water elementals can come out of pools. The most hunted-for ability of pools is the small chance of
getting a wish. It has been said that pools with the color of the PC's eyes are the most beneficial.<p>

About a half-dozen pools are guaranteed to be found in Darkforge.<p>


<A NAME=0.13.10></A><b>0.13.10 Forges</b><p>

Forges are the basic prerequisite for smithing - the PC also needs an anvil, an
item to improve, a hammer and an ingot of the appropriate metal.<p>

A forge is near-guaranteed to be found in the UD. Guaranteed places to
find them include Dwarftown and Darkforge.<p>


<A NAME=0.13.11></A><b>0.13.11 Hives</b><p>

Hives are holes in the floor of the dungeon containing hive creatures, either
ants or bees.  Their population is finite.  There is a guaranteed ant hive on
level two of the puppy cave.<p>


<b>0.13.11.1 Ants</b><p>

Ant hives are simply a source of monsters to be killed with no particular reward
associated with clearing the hive.  Bear in mind that ants dig.  Leaving them
alone and allowing them to dig can be exploited as a source of rocks, ore and 
gems.<p>

Huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping anthills.  When an ant attempts
to leave an anthill covered by a huge rock, the message "The uncursed huge rock
(-10, 10d6) seems to be shaking." is generated. Eventually the huge rock is
destroyed ("Something from below destroys the uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!")
and ants can come out of the hole again. Sometimes this happens after only a few
turns, sometimes it takes more than a hundred. Multiple huge rocks are destroyed
one after another and thus last longer than a single one.<p>


<b>0.13.11.2 Bees</b><p>

Bee hives are filled with giant bee workers, giant bee warriors and a queen bee.
They are a source of beeswax, which can be used to plug the PCs ears.  This deafens
the PC and is one way to survive the Banshee level.  A bee hive is guaranteed to be
generated before the Banshee's level.  They are also a potential source of gelee
royal, which when eaten has a variety of beneficial effects: it is very nourishing,
heals, increases Appearance and cures poisoning.  All of these beneficial effects
will not be experienced simultaneously, of course.  Bees have a poisonous attack,
which kills the attacking bee.  Kicking the hive will cause the bees to become
enraged and swarm the PC.  Kicking the hive apparently increases the chance of
gelee royal generation, although it is not guaranteed.  Currently (in ADOM 1.1.1),
bees generated by kicking the hive are considered summoned and therefore cannot be
sacrificed.  This may well be a bug.  Be careful of this if you are relying on an
altar to get rid of bees.<p>

<A NAME=0.13.13></A><b>0.13.13 Vaults</b><p>

Vaults are large rooms, larger than tension rooms.  Depending on the variety, they can
be nearly completely filled with monsters or only partially filled.  They vary in
danger from moderate (a lesser vault full of gnolls and hyenas), a challenge for PCs
less than experience level ten, to absolutely deadly (a greater vault full of greater
undead), a challenge for experience level 50 PC's who have already won the game.<p>


<b>0.13.13.1 Lesser vaults</b><p>

Lesser vaults generally take up about 1/4 of the screen with an 80 × 25 display.  They
come in every imaginable flavor, from gnolls and hyenas to lesser undead to a variety
of berserkers.  Their danger level is relatively low, comparable to a mixed tension room
on the same level.  There is a guaranteed lesser vault on the bottom level of the Puppy
Cave if you want to see one quickly.  The level message "You feel excited." is always
generated when the PC enters a dungeon level containing a lesser vault.<p>

Here is one possible layout of PC: 6 showing the guaranteed lesser vault in the upper
right portion of the dungeon level:<p>

<b>0.13.13.2 Greater vaults</b><p>

Greater vaults are unmistakable.  They take up half of a standard dungeon level.  The
level message "You feel truly excited." is always generated when the PC enters a dungeon
level containing a greater vault.  It is wise to immediately zap a wand of Monster
Detection to determine the type of vault.  They come in a variety of types, including
fire creatures (fire lizards, red dragons, ancient red dragons, ancient red wyrms),
black dragons, white dragons, giants (hill giants, frost giants, fomorian giants), undead
(vampires, ghosts, ghost lords, emperor lichs) and karmics (karmic lizards, karmic dragons,
ancient karmic dragons).  Greater undead and karmic greater vaults are particularly
challenging.  Some players will simply ignore greater vaults of greater undead, even with
experience level 50 PCs.  This is despite the fact that the rewards for clearing a greater
vault are considerable.  They generally contain one or two artifacts along with substantial
amounts of gold, usually well over 100000 gold pieces.  This is in addition to any equipment
that the monsters might drop, which is considerable in the case of a greater vault full of
dragons.  The amount of experience points available from clearing a greater vault is also
huge.<p>

PCs using good effectivity Frost Bolt or Fire Bolt generally have a fairly easy time clearing
fire- or cold-based creatures, respectively.  However, these ranged spells also destroy some
of the equipment dropped by the monsters.  High level Mindcrafters also have a relatively easy
time with greater vaults (as long as they are not undead!).  Casting Confusion Wave followed
by (Greater) Mental Wave will clear a vault quickly, no muss, no fuss and no equipment
destruction.  Clearing a greater vault with a pure fighter is much more tedious.<p>

Here is an example of a greater vault in the left half of D: 44.  It contained fire creatures:<p>

Note that this map displays an almost guaranteed feature of greater vaults - hidden rooms.
Directly to the north of the PC is a 1 × 3 space.  This was originally a hidden door and a
1 × 2 room containing a monster guarding an artifact, now lying on the floor.  To the east
is a formerly secret 1 × 1 room.  On the other side of the vault are two additional formerly
secret rooms.  The three that did not contain an artifact each contained 30,000+ gold pieces.<p>

Greater fire creature vaults are not always in this configuration.  The hidden rooms vary in
location according to the layout.<p>

More greater vault layouts:<p>

This particular greater vault does not contain small hidden rooms,
although the doorway into the central chamber is initially hidden.<p>

<A NAME=0.13.14></A><b>0.13.14 Royal treasuries</b><p>

Royal treasuries are small hidden rooms generally found in the upper parts of the CoC.  Their
presence is indicated by the "You hear the steps of the royal guard." or "You hear the sound
of falling coins." level messages.  They are disconnected from the rest of the rooms on the
level and thus can only be entered by tunneling or teleportation.  The royal guard within will
not be hostile towards PCs that simply pick up the gold.  Attacking the royal guard is not
really worthwhile.  It does not curse or doom, but is a chaotic act.  Note that eating the
corpse of a royal guard curses the PC.<p>

<A NAME=0.13.15></A><b>0.13.15 Danger levels and top trap types</b><p>

For the moment this is posted preformatted as written by David Byron (thanks!) in the interest
of getting it online.  It will be formatted as time permits.<p>

<pre>

Numbering the traps per the list in the GB:

0  Light trap
1  Corruption trap
2  Stone block trap
3  Alarm
4  Arrow trap
5  Acid trap
6  Pit - this pit is distinct from the other in that it contains vipers
7  Spear trap
8  Teleportation trap
9  Water trap
10 Fireball trap
11 Pit - simple pit, no vipers

In the list the first number is the danger level, then the top trap
type number.  For any Caverns of Chaos levels the danger level equals
the dungeon level and the top trap type is equal to (level x 5) -1

So, for example, on D:1 the trap that you would find in the top left
hand corner of the screen, if you could get there and make one, is
an arrow trap (trap number 4).  Within these lists the ttt just increases
by 5 each time.

(*) I don't know if the danger level of the Shortcut level varies
    with which CoC level it corresponds to - I've only seen S3.
(**) The danger level of the SMC is roughly equal to the PC's level.
(+)  The danger level of the ID is equal to the level of the ID 
     divided by 3 up to a maximum of 45.

(++) ChAoS' corruption rate is special.  Something like 30-50 points
per action.  Not sure if the 90 day limit makes a difference. At any
rate it is not the standard amount for a danger level 48 dungeon.

(xx) The false Minotaur levels have a danger level equal to the
equivalent real Minotaur level.  ie between 26 and 31.  Their
ttt varies.  The progression of the table above does hold, but
since you can't tell one false level from another other than by ttt
I didn't think it was worth writing them down.  I've not seen
14 false Minotaur levels.  There is space for 14 but I've only
seen 12 so far.  If 12 is the maximum there are only 172 locations.
