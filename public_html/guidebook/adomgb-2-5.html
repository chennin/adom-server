Dwarftown is an important milestone in the game.  It is a source of numerous 
helpful NPCs and locations, including a shop, a smithy, a coaligned altar (for 
non-chaotics) and a training hall where stats may be increased.  Of equal 
importance is the fact that it is a resting place.  After the descent through 
the upper CoC, the PC can rest here without constantly being assaulted by monsters.  
There is nothing hostile in Dwarftown initially, with the exception of an 
almost-guaranteed mimic in Waldenbrook's shop (note the empty space in the shop 
in the map below - it is a mimic).<p>

<b>2.5.1 Waldenbrook</b><p>

Waldenbrook is the shopkeeper in Dwarftown.  His is a general store type of shop selling 
and buying a variety of goods.  He occasionally stocks an item or two of high quality, 
sometimes even an artifact.  His prices are generally reasonable.  Bear in mind, however, 
that he has the same racial prejudices as all other shopkeepers (see section 0.13.7).<p>


<b>2.5.2 Ruun</b><p>

Ruun, the Priest in Dwarftown is always generated with the same race as the PC.  He 
presides over a small room containing an altar, which will be coaligned unless the PC is 
chaotic.  If a coaligned PC is carrying unidentified potions, it is worth 'C'hatting with 
him.  He will identify potions that have a healing effect: potions of (extra/ultra) 
healing and potions of cure poison.  If a PC whose alignment does not match the altar's 
'C'hats with him he responds with "Ye oughta convert.  Then we'll talk."<p>

Donating gold to Ruun moves the PC's alignment closer to that of the altar.<p>

Note that converting the altar in Dwarftown (perhaps even attempting to convert it) will 
cause Ruun to become hostile, which in turn causes the entire town to become hostile.  
Luring him out of Dwarftown, killing him and then returning will not work either, as his 
shade returns to inform the dwarves of what has happened, resulting in the same scenario.  
Unless your PC knows exactly what he is doing and why he is doing it, angering or attacking 
Ruun is highly inadvisable.  See also section 2.5.8 below about the Demented Ratling 
and causing commotion in Dwarftown.<p>

The stubborn singlemindedness of the Dwarves regarding Ruun has an interesting side effect.  
If a pet, slave or the greater daemon, for instance, kills Ruun the entire town including 
Thrundarr (but not Waldenbrook) will pursue that creature. This is another way to get 
Thrundarr off his lever.<p>

<A NAME=2.5.3></A>
<b>2.5.3 Thrundarr</b><p>

Thrundarr is the village elder.  He can provide background information on a variety of subjects, 
none of which is really crucial to completing the game.  He assigns six lawful quests regardless 
of alignment.  They are listed in the next section.<p>


<b>2.5.3.1 Thrundarr's quests, their rewards and the significance of the rewards</b><p>

Several quests are available from Thrundarr once the PC achieves experience level six.  
Talking to Thrundarr about 'quest' provides access to them:<p>

The first five quests are available in this order:<p>

1) Slay a random monster. This can be a very annoying quest. The assigned monster is supposedly dependent on the PC's experience level. The reward is having the PC's entire inventory identified or the (artifact) potion of literacy for illiterate characters.<p>

2) Find out what is beyond the animated forest.  The PC has two choices here: traverse the animated 
   forest or bypass it and descend through the Dwarven Halls.  See section 2.5.3.1.1 below about 
   these locations.  The reward for this quest is a blessed wand of fireballs with twelve charges.  
   This comes in very handy in the Pyramid (see section 2.9).<p>

   WARNING:<p>   

   Be very careful when wandering around below Dwarftown before receiving this quest.  Entering 
   the Animated Forest for even a single turn before the quest is assigned results in Thrundarr 
   refusing to assign it, instead assigning another random monster quest with <i>no reward</i>.  Since 
   the wand of fireballs (blessed with twelve charges, no less) can be very useful, entering the 
   Animated Forest before the quest is assigned is very unwise.  Note that this does not occur 
   if the PC enters, or descends below, the Dwarven Halls.<p>

3) Kill the ogre tribe below Dwarftown - the staircase to this level is generated between the 
   Dwarven Mystic's room and the Green Griffon Inn.  See section 2.5.3.1.2 below about this quest. 
   The reward is 5000 gold pieces, useful for training with Garth (see section 2.5.5).<p>

4) Become the Champion of the Arena - if the PC is already the Champion of the Arena, another 
   random monster quest is assigned - a very good reason <i>not</i> to become the Champion until this 
   quest is assigned.  Instead of a cash reward, the PC is given an artifact sword, the Golden
   Gladius, for winning the 20th Arena fight.  Thrundarr's rewards for this quest are usually 
   pieces of equipment which vary according to the class of the PC and possibly the RNG.  
   A couple of examples:<p>

A mindcrafter (probably) received:<p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>blessed mithril cap [+0, +2]<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[40s]
<tr><td>blessed adamantium chain mail (-1, -3) [-1, +8]<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[288s]
<tr><td>blessed mithril girdle [+0, +2]<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[20s]
<tr><td>blessed adamantium long sword (+0, 1d8+5)<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[28s]
<tr><td>blessed medium mithril shield [+5, +1]<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[80s]
<tr><td>blessed ring of fire resistance<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[1s]
<tr><td>blessed adamantium boots [+0, +3]<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[89s]
</table><p>

A wizard and a beastfighter both received:<p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>heap of 8 blessed bandages<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[16s]
<tr><td>blessed waterproof blanket<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[10s]
<tr><td>blessed fireproof blanket<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[10s]
<tr><td>blessed ring of fire resistance<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[1s]
<tr><td>heap of 5 uncursed potions of extra healing<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[10s]
<tr><td>uncursed potion of gain attributes<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[4s]
<tr><td>uncursed potion of ultra healing<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[2s]
<tr><td>blessed scroll of familiar summoning<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[2s]
</table><p>
   The bandages, blankets, etc. seem to be the most common set of equipment received as a reward 
   for this quest.<p>

   These are nice enough, but of no great consequence in the context of the whole game.  Of greater 
   importance is the fact that the PC now has the Golden Gladius.  It can be exchanged for training 
   with Bart the grizzled gladiator.  See section 2.5.7.1 below.<p>

   It is also possible under some circumstances to receive the artifact dwarven shield "Rolf's 
   Saviour" as a reward for this quest.  Lawful alignment is probably a requirement along with 
   cooperation from the RNG.<p>
   
5) Slay a greater daemon that has been terrorizing Dwarftown.  The daemon can be a difficult 
   opponent, particularly if it becomes entangled with the dwarves in the city.  Bear in mind the 
   fact that the greater daemon can kill NPCs who may be helpful later.  This includes the demented 
   ratling, which destroys the possibility of any special ending.  The greater daemon breathes fire 
   and is a stat drainer.  It can be sacrificed on the altar in Dwarftown.  If the PC is lucky enough 
   to have found demon slaying ammo, use it!  There will be more found later.  The reward for this 
   quest is the artifact mace Big Punch, which many PCs find useless because it is so heavy - 800 
   stones.  It is potential sacrificial fodder.<p>

Thrundarr's sixth quest, available at any time and often taken out of order by many players, is to 
free the spirit of Griff Bloodax, a dwarven hero who has been turned into an undead dwarven chaos 
berserker by the master necromancer Nonnak.  It is necessary to ask him about 'portal' to obtain this 
quest.  In return for completing this quest, Thrundarr provides some equipment rewards (see section 
2.7) and more importantly opens the dwarven portal leading to the deeper CoC.  Note that it is not 
strictly necessary to do this quest.  Thrundarr stands on a lever that controls the portal.  If he 
is removed from that location, the PC can 'h'andle the lever himself.  Methods for accomplishing this 
include teleporting Thrundarr, confusing him and killing him.<p>

Thrundarr is teleportation resistant, thus using charges from a wand of teleportation is not 
recommended unless there is no alternative.  A PC with the Teleportation spell has no problem.  
Teleporting him causes no alignment drop; Thrundarr does not become hostile and he will still assign 
quests.  Killing him is a rather drastic act with all sorts of negative consequences.  Using 
ventriloquism on him is fairly easy, confuses him and causes him to wander off the lever.  It causes 
an alignment drop roughly equivalent to killing him but does not curse or doom the PC nor are muscular 
dwarves summoned.  It does make Thrundarr hostile after he recovers from his confusion.  This causes 
an amusing scenario as the non-hostile dwarves encounter a hostile Thrundarr wandering around 
Dwarftown chasing the PC.<p>

Drakeling spit will also cause him to move from the lever without negative consequences. This is 
presumably a bug.<p>

The PC should actually do the quest unless there is a very specific reason not to do so, since there 
are very useful artifacts generated during the quest.  See section 2.7 for more about this quest.<p>


<b>2.5.3.1.1 The Animated Forest and the Dwarven Halls</b><p>

Thrundarr asks the PC to pass through the Animated Forest and find out 
what lies beyond.  He also mentions a possibly dangerous shortcut which 
turn out to be the Dwarven Halls DH: 1 and DH: 2.  On approximately 
D: 15 there will be a level that has two down staircases.  One leads to 
the Animated Forest, the other to the Dwarven Halls.  It is impossible 
to tell them apart.  <p>

Passing through the Animated Forest is a test of one's patience among 
other things.  The entire level is filled with living trees milling 
about.  The majority are not hostile but will of course become hostile 
if attacked.  It is difficult to get through them without accidentally 
hitting one or more.  When the PC encounters hostile trees it is best 
not to try to fight them but rather keep moving.  In fact it is usually 
best to be as defensive as possible and forget about offense completely: 
wield two shields and use Coward tactics.  The hostile trees will 
usually be left behind in the crowd.  It seems to be best to keep moving 
in any case and refrain from resting on one square.  Invisibility is a 
tremendous asset in the Animated Forest, but PCs usually do not have it 
available at this stage of the game.  Note that fireballs, from the wand 
or spell, as well as the Burning Hands spell, should not be used in the 
Animated Forest.  While they are effective, the whole forest becomes 
hostile. This generates too many hostile trees for a PC at this level 
to cope with.  Interestingly, fire bolts, from the spell or wand, are 
also effective, but do not cause the forest to become hostile. The trees
do not see in Darkness, so that tactic can also be used.<p>

The alternative to the tedium of the Animated Forest is a descent through 
the Dwarven Halls.  This is much faster but potentially dangerous.  Very 
out-of-depth monsters can be generated in the Dwarven Halls.  If the PC 
has invisibility, seven league boots or anything that increases speed, 
wear them before entering in case it becomes necessary to flee.  
Exploring other than finding the down stairways is highly inadvisable.<p>

Both of these locations can be problematic.  The Animated Forest is 
always incredibly tedious.  The Dwarven Halls can be a cakewalk if the 
PC is lucky enough to have the stairways generated close together.  
They can also be a virtual instadeath if a very nasty monster shows up.
As Thrundarr says, "It's yer choice."<p>


<b>2.5.3.1.2 The Ogre Cave</b><p>

There is an ogre tribe below Dwarftown which Thrundarr asks the PC 
to eliminate.  This quest is relatively easy compared to getting 
through the Animated Forest or Dwarven Halls.  The ordinary ogres have 
no special attacks and the PC should be able to bash them with brute 
force combined with missile attacks or blast them with magic.  Weaker 
races might find a corpse or two that grants a strength increase.  
Bringing a PC to a starvation state will lower strength, so that the 
chance of a strength increase is improved. A potential problem is the 
ogre magi present on the level.  They are capable of becoming invisible 
and casting Frost Bolt.  PCs who have no cold resistance need to watch 
out for them.  Wear an amulet of the cold heart if the PC has one. 
There are also a couple of ogre lords present, which are tougher than 
the ordinary ogres. None of the ogres can see in Darkness. 
There is a bug in the game which prevents pets from inflicting any 
damage on the level. Do not rely on them.<p>


<b>2.5.4 The Dwarven Mystic</b><p>

The Dwarven Mystic is found in a 2 × 2 sealed room east of the room
containing the altar.  The most common way to get in is by teleporting.  
The Dwarven Mystic used to be a guaranteed source of the artifact 
dwarven rune axe Rolf's Companion for non-chaotics. Neutrals never 
receive the axe but rather some items which vary.  It can be four 
scrolls of chaos resistance and/or seven blessed potions of insight, 
potions of extra healing or other equipment. Several gammas ago, 
Rolf's Companion was a very powerful artifact.  Recently, it has been 
weakened to the point that many players regard the possibility of 
getting four scrolls of chaos resistance from the Dwarven Mystic as an 
argument for neutral alignment at this point in the game.  Chaotics 
will receive nothing from him.  He responds with the message "It 
wasn't you I've been waiting for!"<p>

Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated adjacent to 
and within the dwarven mystic's room.  However, this is only possible if 
Dwarftown is generated on D: 11:<p>
<pre>
  .....^
  .####.
  .#.^#.
  .#^.#.
  .####.
  ^.....
</pre>
The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be created.<p>

It is also possible to open the walls of the Dwarven Mystic's room 
with a wand of destruction.  This is somewhat dangerous, since nearby 
townspeople, and perhaps the Dwarven Mystic himself, may be damaged by 
the blast, causing some, or all, inhabitants of Dwarftown to become 
hostile.  If the player is careful, it is possible to destroy the 
walls, 'C'hat with the Dwarven Mystic and receive his rewards in the 
usual manner.<p>

If a PC with non-chaotic alignment has committed a crime in Dwarftown 
which results in an alarm gong being rung and muscular dwarves being 
summoned, the Dwarven Mystic responds with a different message "Ye art 
doomed!"  This does not result in the PC gaining the cursed or doomed 
intrinsics.  A wished-for Dwarven Mystic also always responds with 
this message.<p>


<b>2.5.5 Garth and Training</b><p>

Garth is the dwarven weaponmaster found in the training hall east of 
Thrundarr's room.  Garth will train all stats except Appearance and 
Mana.  The formula for how much to pay is $100 × stat value, doubled 
once for each 5 points over 15.  Here are examples of what to pay Garth:<p>

<table border=1>
<th width=40% align=left>Stat score</th><th width=60% align=left>Payment</th>
<tr><td>1-15<td>100 - 1500gp (100x)
<tr><td>16-20<td>3200 - 4000gp (200x)
<tr><td>21-25<td>8400 - 10000gp (400x)
<tr><td>26-30<td>20800 - 24000gp (800x)
<tr><td>31-35<td>49600 - 56000gp (1600x)
<tr><td>36-40<td>115200 - 128000gp (3200x)
<tr><td>41-45<td>262400 - 288000gp (6400x)
<tr><td>46-50<td>588800 - 640000gp (12800x)
</table>
<p>
Note that the effects of training do not happen instantaneously.  The 
stat has simply been trained.  The game checks every so often (and 
always when gaining an experience level) to see if a stat is eligible 
for an increase.  This is when the stat will rise.  Note also that it 
is possible to pay Garth once and receive several stat increases as a 
result.  This is particularly useful for those PC's with a very low stat 
score in one or more categories.  Paying Garth well in excess of the 
amount needed to raise the stat will result in multiple stat increases 
over time.<p>

Note that there is a manual entry under the Attributes section that 
states the following:<p>

"The potential maximum attribute scores are based on the initial
attribute scores. The maximum for an attribute is dependent on the
base score and the player race.  These maximums can only rarely be
surpassed by natural training.  This is a long and arduous process.
Only magical methods can exceed these limits with ease."<p>

This seems to imply that Garth cannot train a stat beyond its natural 
maximum.  This may be true under "reasonable" circumstances.  Giving 
Garth massive amounts of gold may be a different story.<p>


<b>2.5.6 Glod and Smithing</b><p>

Glod, the dwarven smith in Dwarftown, will teach the Smithing skill.  
There is a price for this which seems to depend on Charisma,  
Appearance or both.  The base price seems to vary from as low as 800 
to as high as 30000 gold pieces, and seems to be heavily influenced 
by race.<p>

Glod is also capable of removing rust from rusted items and fixing 
certain broken items, notably pickaxes, again, for a price. It has been 
reported that after removing rust from an item a number of times, Glod 
will offer to rustproof the item.<p>

After learning the Smithing skill, Glod will make his equipment 
available to the PC for a price, typically 2500 gold pieces.<p>

It is possible to teleport Glod away from his smithy, although the 
details (wand of teleportation vs the Teleportation spell) have yet to 
be worked out.  He wanders in Dwarftown but still asks for the nominal 
2500 gold piece fee (seemingly telepathically, probably a bug) after 
this.  However, at this point, he can be lured off the level if he is 
adjacent to a staircase, like any other inhabitant of Dwarftown.  After 
Glod is left on another level, his demands for payment cease.  Note 
that this may involve considerable tedium as the PC attempts to lure 
Glod off the level.<p>

It is possible to kill Glod (using acid spit or bolt spells while 
invisible, for instance) without making the rest of Dwarftown 
hostile (although Waldenbrook may become hostile), thus making his 
smithy available for free.  One method of doing this involves using 
the greater daemon generated by Thrundarr's fifth quest.  If the 
greater daemon is lured near Glod, it will kill Glod.<p>


<b>2.5.7 The Green Griffon Inn</b><p>

The Green Griffon Inn holds two useful NPCs described below.  It is 
located in the southeast corner of Dwarftown.<p>


<b>2.5.7.1 Bart</b><p>

Bart provides teaching in three skills: Backstabbing, Tactics and Two 
Weapon Combat in exchange for the Golden Gladius, the artifact sword 
provided as a reward for winning the 20th Arena fight.  Tactics is 
available only from him.  He also provides some training in weapon 
skills, raising all zero level skills to level one and providing small 
bonuses to other weapon skils.  The number of weapon marks that he 
gives seems to be (learning score)d10.  The training in weapon skills 
is secondary as compared to granting the Tactics skill, which is of 
much greater importance in the game.<p>


<b>2.5.7.2 Torgall</b><p>

Torgall is the innkeeper in the Green Griffon Inn.  He is a source of 
rumors, for the price of an ale.<p>


<b>2.5.8 The Demented Ratling</b><p>

The Demented Ratling is an important NPC for all PCs trying for a 
special ending.  He demands to be fed six artifacts in exchange for 
revealing the secret of the Stone Circle, where the Crown of Chaos can 
be found.  He will only talk to chaotic PCs.  He becomes much more 
powerful each time he is fed an artifact.  This is important to remember.  
If the PC is going to cause commotion in Dwarftown, for example in order 
to fulfill Kherab's second quest, it should only be done after feeding a 
number of artifacts to the demented ratling.  Otherwise the demented 
ratling may be killed in the ensuing battle for control of Dwarftown.<p>

A wished-for demented ratling will make the usual demand for six 
artifacts from a chaotic PC, but will not eat an artifact.  Instead, he 
responds with "Ya naw will neeta die!"  He is not necessarily hostile 
after this.<p>

It is possible to anger the demented ratling to the point where he will 
attack by swapping places with him several times. Repeatedly (about 
five times) talking to him after giving him artifacts will also make him 
hostile.<p>
