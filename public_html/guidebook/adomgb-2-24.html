<H3>The Quickling Tree</H3>

<A HREF="adomgb-2-24-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the quickling tree.<p>

The Quickling Tree can be found in any portion of the forested 
wilderness west of the river.  This means that a PC should 
's'earch for it in a convenient place, such as next to the Mad 
Minstrel's clearing.  It can be found at any time, but to actually 
enter it usually requires two corruptions: the extrememly thin 
and nimble and the very light corruptions. This is because the PC 
must weigh no more than ten kilos to enter the tree. Hurthlings are 
often an exception: they can enter the quickling tree with only the 
thin and nimble corruption (which is required under any circumstances).  
Also, the weight of the PCs inventory is limited to 160 stones.  This 
means eternium plate mails, crowns of leadership and the like are not 
going to be useful.  In fact it is worth picking up any light armor the 
PC finds throughout the game and identifying all of it at some point in 
case any of it is useful in the quickling tree.<p>

Quicklings use hand crossbows and dark elven quarrels as missile 
weapons and drop them as they are killed.  Some prior experience 
with crossbows is therefore useful.  Quicklings fall fairly easily 
in melee, with missile weapons or using magic.  They are just very, 
very fast. Only the king and queen see in Darkness and see invisible<p>

The whole point of entering the quickling tree is to eat the corpses 
of the quicklings as they are killed, which provides speed bonuses.  
There are plenty of corpses generated for a PC with a good Food 
Preservation skill, so an amulet of hunger or stomacemptia herbs are 
useful in the tree.  As would be expected, the higher level quickling 
corpses give better speed bonuses, so the quickling lord corpses 
should be eaten first.  The tree contains a quickling king and 
quickling queen, whose corpses provide the best speed bonuses if they 
are generated, but they also shorten the PC's life span.  This is where 
those potions of longevity come in handy for races with relatively 
short life spans.<p>

The quickling queen stands on a pair of artifact boots, the Boots of 
Great Speed, greater identified as follows:<p>

---------------- boots of great speed [+5, +0] (+30 spd)--------------<p>

When worn it modifies DV by +5 and PV by +0.<br>
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes <br>
1d3 points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus <br>
to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.<p>

It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.<br>
It modifies your speed by +30.<br>
It grants bad luck.<br>
Wearing it makes you doomed.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

If it is desired, the PC may tunnel directly south from the entrance 
room into the room containing the high level quicklings.<p>

Time passes very quickly in the quickling tree. It is not unusual 
to enter on day 70 and find that it is day 140 upon emerging. This 
means the 90 day limit has passed and background corruption rate 
doubles. Ideally a PC will do the quickling tree right before 
the final dive to the lowest levels of the CoC.<p>
