<H3>The Small Cave</H3>

<b>1.2.3.1 Objectives, strategy for survival and items found in the Small Cave</b><p>

The Small Cave is a popular place to start the game.  It contains one very 
useful guaranteed item and often contains other non-guaranteed desirable items.  
The guaranteed items in the Small Cave are a scroll of information, a scroll of 
warning and a waterproof blanket.  The scroll of information simply tells how 
many paces away the waterproof blanket is.  A dungeon square seems to be roughly 
two paces by this measure.  The blanket itself is found in one of the farthest 
squares from the entrance in an east-west direction.  The scroll of warning gives some 
advice about tactics for the small cave.  It reads "Time is working against you!" 
This is true.  When the PC enters the small cave, monsters are generated on the 
level as is true of any dungeon level.  As the original monsters are killed off, 
new monsters are generated.  The new monsters are generated differently than 
on any other level in the game.  They have approximately double the experience 
level of the PC.  As might be imagined, this quickly gets very difficult to 
cope with and is the basis for the eternium man challenge game (see the 
<A HREF="challenge.html"> challenge games</A> section).  This offers a way to 
quickly gain experience levels, but as a rule, PCs should get out of the Small 
Cave by experience level 5 at most.<p>

The Small Cave also contains a down staircase which leads to the Unremarkable 
Dungeon.  The Unremarkable Dungeon is normal in terms of danger and monster 
generation.  It is also essential to enter the Unremarkable Dungeon at some 
point if the PC plans to try a special ending.<p>

Out of depth weapons are sometimes found in the Small Cave.  Eternium two-handed 
swords and halberds of defense are examples.  Artifacts can be generated in the 
Small Cave, but this is rare.  Altars can also be generated in the Small Cave.<p>

Less interesting items are virtually guaranteed as well.  The Small Cave always 
seems to contain some type of cloak, one or more quarterstaves and a shield of 
some type.  These items are typically of low quality but useful in the early game 
nonetheless.<p>

The general strategy for the Small Cave is to get in, find the waterproof blanket 
as quickly as possible, optionally find the down staircase and get out.  Getting 
out can be via descent through the Unremarkable Dungeon or ascent back to the 
wilderness.<p>

Note that the monsters generated in the Small Cave are in general common types: 
goblins, kobolds, bats, rats and the like.  Making a first kill in the Small Cave 
is not a good idea if a special ending is planned (see section 0.9.1).<p>

<b>1.2.3.2 Should PCs descend through the Unremarkable Dungeon?</b><p>

After retrieving the waterproof blanket and locating the down stairs in the Small 
Cave (easier said than done), PCs may choose to descend through the Unremarkable 
Dungeon.  As mentioned, it is essential to go through this dungeon in order to 
complete a special ending.  If the PC chooses to do this, the Kranach quest will 
be lost, since the PC will be greater than experience level six by the time the 
Unremarkable Dungeon is traversed.  The chance to complete the puppy quest 
successfully will also be lost, since the four day time limit will expire by the 
time the PC manages to get back to Terinyo.  Despite the fact that monsters are 
generated in the Small Cave at twice the PC's experience level, it is possible 
to leave the Small Cave and reenter it later in order to gain access to the 
Unremarkable Dungeon.  One way is to use invisibility.  The monsters generated 
are high level relative to the PC, but they are not in general "special" monsters 
that have the ability to see invisible.  Thus a high level PC can use invisibility 
to make a quick dash through the Small Cave and descend to the Unremarkable Dungeon. 
Items that grant invisibility are by no means guaranteed so this strategy is not 
available to every PC.  Many players will descend through the Unremarkable Dungeon 
every time if possible.<p>

Alternatively, a higher level PC can attempt to avoid killing anything on his 
search for the down staircase. This is sometimes impossible and risky in any case.<p>

<b>1.2.3.2.1 The nature of the Unremarkable Dungeon</b><p>

The Unremarkable Dungeon is (probably deliberately by TB) misnamed.  It is quite 
remarkable.  It generally contains more special features - altars, pools, forges, 
herbs, shops and the like, than any other dungeon in the game.  These are all nice 
features.  The Unremarkable Dungeon also seems to contain more door traps than any 
other dungeon, which is not so nice.  The bottom level of the Unremarkable 
Dungeon, UD: 8, contains two up staircases.  One of the staircases leads to 
the High Mountain Village.<p>

<b>1.2.3.2.2 The High Mountain Village - introduction</b><p>

The High Mountain Village is an interesting wilderness location.  It contains a shop 
and various NPCs who are mostly useful to chaotics and essential for those PCs 
attempting a special ending.  One significant problem is the possibility of meeting 
a Stone Giant Lord upon entering the High Mountain Village.  This monster is very 
difficult to defeat for a relatively low level PC that has descended directly from 
the Small Cave through the Unremarkable Dungeon to the High Mountain Village.  The 
Stone Giant Lord is not generated every time, but the possibility is an argument 
against entering the Unremarkable Dungeon directly from the Small Cave with a low 
level PC.  If that is the plan, enter with full HPs and Coward tactics. It is 
possible to lure the Stone Giant Lord, and monsters in general, to the right side of 
the map, leave and reenter from the left. The High Mountain Village contains a hidden 
exit to the northern central part of the wilderness map.  It is found from the inside 
of the western village wall.  This means that the PC need not go all the way back 
through the Unremarkable Dungeon and the Small Cave in order to exit.<p>

More on the High Mountain Village is found in section 2.21.<p>
