<H3>The Assassins' Guild</H3>

The Assassins' Guild is located in the wilderness, west of the river that divides 
the Drakalor Chain.  The entrance is described as "A rather boring cave entrance."  
It consists of three levels.<p>


<b>2.11.1 The DDL</b><p>

The first level is named the DDL and contains no unique special features, although 
it may contain any of the normal dungeon features: traps, herbs, rivers, etc.<p>


<b>2.11.2 The VDDL</b><p>

Upon entering the second level, the message "This dungeon is very dusty." is 
generated.  This level contains many, many teleportation traps and can be annoying 
without teleport control.  It also contains one guaranteed item: a wand of 
teleportation.  The wand is always next to the down staircase found on the level 
in a 1 x 2 room that is separated from the rest of the level.  It can only be 
reached by digging or teleportation.  In practice, the easiest way to find the 
down staircase is to zap a wand of item detection.  This will reveal the location 
of the wand, which the PC can then dig or teleport to, thus revealing the 
staircase.  Alternatively a scroll of magic mapping will reveal the location of 
the down staircase. Note that it is possible for a monster to be standing on the 
wand, so teleportation may fail.<p>


<b>2.11.2.1 The hidden stairway and how to descend</b><p>

The hidden down staircase in the VDDL is like no other in the game.  It is itself 
a teleportation trap and will attempt to teleport the PC away when he tries to 
descend.  Needless to say, this is extremely frustrating without teleport control.  
There is a requirement to trigger a certain number of teleportation traps on the 
level before the PC can descend.  This can be done with either the normal 
teleportation traps or the staircase itself.  However, it is much more efficient 
to use teleportation traps that are far away from the down staircase.  They are up 
to six times faster at increasing the count of unsuccessful attempts.  Just keep 
trying until the PC receives the message "You suddenly feel attuned to this area 
in a very special way."  It is then possible to descend.<p>


<b>2.11.3 The final level</b><p>

The final level of the Assassins' Guild has no proper name; it is only named with 
four question marks: "????".  There are definite precautions necessary on this 
level.  The PC initially descends into a 3 x 3 room containing four assassins.  
The assassins are not particularly dangerous opponents, although they use poison.  
There is a safe passage available through the level which is free of traps, 
otherwise the level is full of traps.  The PC <i>must not</i> use missile weapons on 
the level.  If he does, a general alarm is sounded and the Assassin Prince, who 
is very important to the special endings, becomes hostile and refuses to give 
quests later in the game.  Likewise, a failed pickpocket attempt, or attempting 
to pickpocket the same assassin twice, will raise the general alarm.  Also be 
careful during the melee.  If an assassin panics, leave him alone.  Attacking 
panic-stricken assassins will also make the Assassin Prince hostile.  In their 
panicked state, they may begin attacking each other or the Assassin Prince 
himself.  Pay no attention to them.  The level contains assassins, master 
assasins, holy slayers, gray slayers, muggers, dopplegangers and doppleganger 
lords.<p>

Teleportation is not allowed on this level.<p>

Obviously, there are some nasty monsters here and there is no particular objective 
for low-level PCs, other than killing the monsters for experience.  The PC may 
elect to skip this level until much later in the game.<p>


<b>2.11.3.1 The Assassin Prince</b><p>

The Assassin Prince is the source of the Filk Quest, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel.  
This quest is only necessary for the Ultra endings.  See section 4.3.1.1 for a 
description of this quest and its requirements.  If a PC is not planning to do an 
Ultra ending, it may be worth killing the Assassin Prince for the artifact dagger 
Sting, which he carries.  Note two things: the Assassin Prince has been described 
as the offspring of a moloch and a quickling queen - he's not quite that bad, but 
he is a very difficult opponent - and second, Sting is really only worth acquiring if 
the PC has or plans to obtain its companion dagger Needle, available from 
Sharad-Waador (see section 3.9).<p>
