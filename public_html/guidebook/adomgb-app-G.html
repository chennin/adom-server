<H3>Appendix G - Food - complete list</H3>

<HR size = "2">

<p><b>Thanks to Malte Helmert for working out all details of this Appendix</b>

<p>Most "base" PCs use one unit of nutrition each turn. The units of nutrition
for the various food items are listed below. None of the following applies
to food consumption in the big wilderness map, where different rules apply
(maybe just a multiplier).

Apart from equipment, the formula for a PC's food consumption per turn is
as follows:

<p><table border="1">

<tr><td> 1 <td>standard
<tr><td>+1 <td>for Trolls
<tr><td>+1 <td>when Strained or Strained!
<tr><td>+2 <td>when Overburdened!

</table><p>

The total value after those modifiers is halved for Farmers of Level 12+
and monks of any level. So, for example, an overburdened human fighter
would consume 3 units per turn, and a strained! troll monk would consume
1.5 units per turn. In this case, fractions are <i>not</i> rounded away: The
character will alternate between consuming 1 and 2 units.

After that, additional modifiers apply, which are <i>not</i> halved for monks
or farmers:

<p><table border="1">

<tr><td>+3 <td>for each (!) equipped item granting Invisibility
<tr><td>+0.5 <td>for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for uncrowned or fallen champion PCs
<tr><td>+0.25 <td>for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for crowned PCs
<tr><td>+15<td>in the wilderness, for non-Trolls
<tr><td>+30<td>in the wilderness, for Trolls
 
</table><p>

Food consumption in the wilderness is independent of movement speed, including seven 
league boots, and terrain type.<p>

So, for example, a strained troll barbarian, crowned chaotic, wearing 7
artifacts and one item granting Invisibility will consume 7 units per turn
(1 standard, 1 troll, 1 strained, 7/4 rounded down = 1 for the artifacts,
3 for the invisibility).<p>

From all experiments conducted with WADOMF and g16pre2, there was no
influence caused by:

<ul>
<li>alignment (some suggested that only champions of law get the artifact discount, but it is identical for chaotics and presumably neutrals)
<li>being a fallen champion (that is, there is no special penalty - it's just like not being crowned)
<li>any corruption (the suspicious mana battery and corrupted tissue corruptions were tested)
<li>any intrinsic (particularly, intrinsic invisiblity does not increase food consumption - this was very surprising; likewise, the doomed/cursed/lucky/Fate Smiles intrinsics have no effect)
<li>the invisibility spell
<li>being a Healer or being born in the month of Candle
<li>HP or PP regeneration rate, having eaten Troll corpses, having drunk potions of troll blood or raw mana, wielding regenerating items - the last is very surprising
</ul>

<p>The different satiation categories are:

<p><table border="1">

<tr><th>Satiation level
<th>Satiation display

<tr><td>2501+<td>Bloated
<tr><td>1501..2500 <td>Satiated
<tr><td>200..1500<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>100..199 <td>Hungry
<tr><td>50..99 <td>Hungry!
<tr><td>0..49<td><font color="red">Starving</font>

</table><p>

A character with satiation level 0 has a random chance of dying because
of starvation each turn. In g16p2 and later versions, apparently no food
consumption takes place while eating, so it should be impossible to starve
to death while eating (unlike previous versions).<p>

Note also that starvation does not kill until Strength has dropped to half of what it was when the <font color="red">Starving</font> message is shown. There is a -4 drop on getting to <font color="red">Starving</font> status. From there Strength and other stats will continue to drop until Strength reaches 50% of its value when <font color="red">Starving</font> status was reached. (Thanks to johonka for this info on <font color="red">Starving</font>)<p>

</table><p>

The satiation value is increased by 25% for blessed items and decreased by 50% for cursed items.

<p><table border="1">

<tr><th>Special
<th>Meaning

<tr><td>1<td>unidentified appear as strange herb; can be identified by picking with the Herbalism skill
<tr><td>2<td>susceptible to rotting
<tr><td>3<td>unidentified appear as bit of candy;
 can be identified by taste: plain = 'sweet', gnomish = 'annoyingly sweet';
 children will only accept plain candy
<tr><td>4<td>unidentified appear as seed
<tr><td>5<td>more nutritious for dark elves: cursed = 2010, uncursed =1020, blessed = 125;
 this unusual fact is in fact intentional
<tr><td>6<td>more nutritious for orcs (2X), trolls (3X), barbarians (3X) and beastfighters (3X);
 if a PC falls into more than one category, only the higher bonus applies - i.e.
 orcish beastfighters are 3X; drakelings receive a different message than other races
 but get the usual 500 satiation points
<tr><td>7<td>Fried fish meat indeed has a fractional weight. If a stack of fried fish meat contains
 an odd number of pieces, the weight of the stack is rounded up

</table><p>

Stomafillia herbs are different in that their b/u/c status is more
influential than for other food items: They yield 6250/2000/550 points of
satiation depending on whether they are blessed, uncursed or cursed.

<p>Stomacemptia herbs are the only non-corpse food items that lower the
satiation level. Even bad ratling food, despite yielding the "you vomit"
message, satiates slightly. Stomacemptia herbs do not apply a fixed
modifier but behave a bit differently:

<p>If the character is not yet starving, the new satiation level is set to a
fixed value depending on the b/u/c status of the herb (rows) and the old
satiation value (columns):

<p><table border="1">

<tr><th>Status<th>50..99 <th>100..199 <th>200..1500<th>1501+

<tr><td>blessed <td>49 <td>99 <td>199<td>1500
<tr><td>uncursed<td>49 <td>49 <td>99 <td>199
<tr><td>cursed<td>49 <td>49 <td>49 <td>49

</table><p>

Put in words, blessed herbs always set the satiation level to the highest
possible value of the next lower category (from satiated to normal, from
normal to hungry, from hungry to very hungry, from very hungry to
starving), uncursed herbs go two such steps, and cursed herbs always go
down to starving.

<p>If the character is already starving (satiation value 0..49), then the
satiation value is decreased by 20, but not below 0, irrespective of b/u/c
status of the herb.

<p>It is possible to wish for "satiation" or "food". This sets the satiation
level to 5000 if it was below this value. It does nothing otherwise.

<p>Scrolls of satiation add 2000/1000/0 to the satiation level
if blessed/uncursed/cursed.

<p>Apart from corpses, the only food items that can be cooked are raw meat
and fish meat, as noted in the table. Unlike corpses, they can only be
cooked with the cooking skill; fire destroys them.

<p>From preliminary testing, it seems that apples and pieces of raw meat rot
at approximately the same rate.<p>
