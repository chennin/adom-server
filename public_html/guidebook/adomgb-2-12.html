<H3>The Tomb of the High Kings</H3>

<A HREF="adomgb-2-12-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the Tomb of the High Kings.<p>

The Tomb of the High Kings is located in a dungeon found in the northwest 
corner of the Drakalor Chain.  The PC must have a climbing set to reach it 
(and to leave that section of the map).  The fact that a climbing set is 
required means that the PC must do some work to find one prior to entering 
the dungeon.  This ensures that low level PCs do not enter this location.  
The dungeon consists of two normal levels followed by three cavernous levels 
leading to the tomb.  The cavernous levels are somewhat challenging, as are 
most cavernous levels.<p>

The tomb itself consists of a short winding corridor leading to a large 
chamber.  The chamber contains a lake which is unique in that the water is 
red rather than blue.  This should serve as a warning.  It is filled with 
chaos piranhas that deal over 200 points of damage during each turn the PC 
is in the lake.  This is the place where the Bridge Building skill or the 
ability to freeze water (yielded by the Terinyo quests) becomes vital.<p>

Teleportation is not allowed on this level, so do not count on it to get 
your PC out of a tight spot.<p>
 
The PC must build a bridge or create an ice bridge to an island located in 
the lake.  Remember that ice bridges will only hold the PC's weight plus 
2000 stones before breaking.  Anything that freezes water will work including 
monsters (section 0.14.7). On the island is a 1 × 1 room protected by a 
locked and trapped door.  Upon opening the door, a skeletal king is found 
guarding the Ring of the High Kings.  The skeletal king is a somewhat nasty 
foe who is able to confuse the PC.  This is not a good thing when the PC is 
perched on a bridge, liable to stumble to certain death in the piranha 
infested waters below.  Some means of confusion resistance is therefore 
highly recommended.  If the PC does become confused, use the 'E'ar cleaning 
command or 'a'pplying First Aid to immobilize the PC until the confusion wears 
off.  The skeletal king is immune to the chaos piranahs so luring him into 
the lake will not kill him.  He is vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of 
course.  He is not difficult to kill in melee for a mid-level PC with a 
decent melee attack.  He never summons help on his own level, but if lured 
off the level, he will. He does not see invisible.<p>
 
The objective of this dungeon, the Ring of the High Kings, is Greater 
Identified as follows:<p>

-------------------- blessed ring of the High Kings [+2, +3]-------------------<p>

It is an artifact.<p>

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +3.<br>
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.<p>

It grants resistance to fire.<br>
It grants resistance to poison.<br>
It grants resistance to cold.<br>
It grants resistance to shock attacks.<p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

The Greater Identify does not reveal the most important property of the ring, 
however: it allows peaceful passage past the Eternal Guardian (see section 3.2).<p>
