<b>2.21.1 The Stone Giant Lord</b><p>

Sometimes there is a Stone Giant Lord generated outside the High Mountain 
Village walls near where the PC enters from the wilderness.  Needless to 
say, this can be a nasty surprise for a relatively low level PC who has 
descended through the Unremarkable Dungeon at the beginning of the game.  
If you can't run away, an attack with berserk tactics may work if the PC 
has a decent weapon.  He is vulnerable to magic.<p>


<b>2.21.2 Hawkslayer</b><p>

The burly adventurer in the High Mountain Village will join a PC and act 
as a companion providing certain criteria are met: the PC must not be 
chaotic and the player (<i>not</i> the PC) must know a secret password 
("Iceberg"). The only way to learn the password in ADOM itself 
is drinking from pools, and many players are reluctant to do so. Some 
players may remember Hawkslayer from the computer RPG "Bard's Tale III". 
The password is the same in that game.  There is also an experience level 
requirement which is uncertain.  Level 25 PC's have successfully gotten 
Hawkslayer as a companion, so that stands as a maximum level for the 
requirement at the moment.<p>

Hawkslayer is not super-buff as companions go, but he is not bad.<p>

On arriving at the HMV with a level 15 PC and using a blessed 
stethoscope on him, Hawkslayer was found to be:<p>

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 24, PV: 15, Hits: 355, Attacks: 1, Damage: 14-50. Speed: 120.<p>

A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup on September 14th, 2000 
described a PC who was very careful with Hawkslayer to start, training 
him in the upper levels of the CoC, proceeding to the Big Room then 
deeper into the CoC until he was able to take on molochs and balors.  
Using a blessed stethoscope on him at that point gave the following:<p>

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 110, 
DV: 96, PV: 36, Hits: 805, Attacks: 11, Damage: 50-86. Speed:120.<p>

Quite impressive.<p>

Hawkslayer uses arrows which can be retrieved for the PC's own use.<p>


<b>2.21.3 Ratling guardians</b><p>

Two ratling guardians are found at the entrance to the city.  They seem to 
be flavor elements more than anything else and play no real role in the plot 
of the game.<p>

Thanks to gut for the following:<p>

They have a peculiarity that makes them useful for one thing. This strategy 
is really only worthwhile if the PC has no means of teleportation, and no 
potions of invisibility, or Leggot sees invisible too quickly. They are 
motionless, and will let the PC swap places with them. This means they can 
be maneuvered in front of Leggot's shop. Place a ratling near the doorway, 
gather the shop items, repeatedly drop them and pick them up until the 
shopkeeper doesn't block the doorway (this can take many tries, and being 
fast helps), stand in the doorway, and swap places with the ratling. An 
alarm sounds, and the PC will be cursed if it's not chaoticly aligned. Just 
kill or outrun the summoned thugs, which the PC should be able to do at this 
point in the game. Leggot won't kill the ratling to get at you, and many 
thugs will be trapped in his shop as well, they will just look on angrily 
as you leave. : )<p>


<b>2.21.4 Leggot</b><p>

Leggot is the shopkeeper in the High Mountain Village.  He may offer better 
prices than Waldenbrook, the shopkeeper in Dwarftown, both when selling items 
and buying items.  He does not share Waldenbrook's hatred of dark elves.<p>


<b>2.21.5 Ogre guardian</b><p>

Like the ratling guardians, the ogre guardian plays no real part in the game. 
He guards a prison in the High Mountain Village which holds a few monsters.  
The ogre guardian does not react if the PC opens the jail and kills the 
monsters within.  If the ogre guardian becomes hostile, he is capable of 
throwing huge rocks at the PC.<p>

<A NAME=2.21.6></A>
<b>2.21.6 Gaab'Baay</b><p>

Gaab'Baay is of critical importance for those attempting a special ending.  She 
assigns several quests; the reward is the Medal of Chaos, which is required to 
pass through the Chaos Gate. To receive her first quest, the PC must be some flavor 
of chaotic alignment. As soon as the first quest is assigned, the PC is free to 
change alignment. This is wise, since the more experienced a PC becomes, the more 
difficult it becomes to move alignment away from chaotic. She will not assign quests 
until the demented ratling has been given six artifacts ("Talk to the mutated one."). 
Her quests are as follows: 1) Bring her the skull of a giant boar.  An annoying quest. 
Giant boars can only be found randomly in the wilderness, and rarely leave skulls, 
even for PCs that have Food Preservation at 100. This quest can literally take months 
of game time to complete, causing elapsed game time to exceed the 90 day point at 
which time background corruption rate doubles.  2) Bring a potion of cure 
corruption.  These can be obtained from Guth'Alak (see section 0.10.3.1.1). 
It is worth taking the time to get one from Guth'Alak, since they are very rare 
otherwise. 3) Bring the corpse of a farmer. Quite often a farmer will be wandering 
around the outside of the High Mountain Village. Otherwise they can be found in 
Terinyo. It seems farmers leave a corpse more often after this quest is assigned, 
but the effect has not been quantitated. So if you are playing a wild chaotic, use 
some restraint and don't wipe out all farmers just because they are easy to kill. 
It might also be prudent to kill off the stone giant lord outside the HMV if one is 
generated.  You don't want him killing off your farmer. 4) Bring a scroll of danger. 
Another scarce item. If the PC finds one, it should be put somewhere safe until it is 
needed.  5) Bring a wand of monster creation. Note that a cursed wand of monster 
creation will work, but one with zero charges left will not.  After successfully 
delivering all of these items, Gaab'Baay produces the Medal of Chaos.  Note that it, 
like all parts of the Chaos Trinity, corrupts the PC merely by carrying it.  Leave it 
somewhere safe until it is needed.<p>


<b>2.21.7 The Oracle</b><p>

The Oracle dispenses advice to PCs with all three parts of the Chaos Trinity about 
how to become a chaos god. However, it is no longer necessary to have all three 
parts of the Chaos Trinity to enter the Chaos Gate. Interaction with the Oracle in 
ADOM 1.0.0+ has not been thoroughly investigated.<p>

The corpse of the Oracle grants +6 to Learning but also curses and dooms the PC. 
Beware of attacking the Oracle.  She is capable of casting Death Ray and shares the 
properties of karmic beings, although she is not named as such. She can safely be 
killed with missiles, since she cannot move from her island. Just stay out of direct 
line. To get the best benefit from her corpse bless it and have Le under 20. Remember 
where the nearest altar is to remove the cursing and dooming.<p>


<b>2.21.8 The malicious doctor</b><p>

The malicious doctor has a flesh golem companion for sale for 25,000 gold pieces.  He 
plays no other part in the game.  From the reports of those who have acquired this 
companion, it is not worth the money. If the player wants this companion, it is worth 
luring the malicious doctor to the SMC before buying it.  In that case it is generated 
with much more experience.<p>

Note that the malicious doctor will not sell this companion to lawful PCs.  When lawful 
PCs 'C'hat with him, the game responds with "The malicious doctor eyes you with 
suspicion.  "My office is closed." "<p>


<b>2.21.9 Ratling traders</b><p>

Ratling traders are occasionally generated in the High Mountain Village.  Like many 
other random monsters in the High Mountain Village, they are quite often hostile.  
If the PC needs food at this point, don't kill hostile ratling traders.  They may 
eventually become nonhostile and therefore a source of food.<p>


<b>2.21.10 Hidden locations</b><p>

There are three hidden locations in the High Mountain Village.  Gaab'Baay is located in 
a hidden passageway along the eastern wall.  Two scrolls are located in the doorless 
room in the center of the northern wall.  The only way to enter this room is with 
teleportation.  Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated adjacent to 
and within the room:<p>
<pre>
  #######
  .#.?.#.
  .#^..#.
  .#####.
  ^......
</pre>
The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be created.  A teleportation 
trap can also be created on the square where the scrolls lie, of course.<p>

The two scrolls are a cursed scroll of chaos resistance and a "strange 
message".  See section 5.2 for the contents.  The final location is a hidden passage in 
the western wall.  It contains a potion of ultra healing and a staircase behind yet 
another hidden door.  The staircase leads to the northern central part of the wilderness.<p>
