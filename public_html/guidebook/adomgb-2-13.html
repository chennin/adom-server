<H3>The Water Dragon's Lair</H3>

<A HREF="adomgb-2-13-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the Water Dragon's Lair.<p>

The water dragon's lair is located in a random water-containing 
square of the wilderness.  It contains Shyssiryxius, the water 
dragon (Blup's mother), her treasure hoard and various other 
aquatic beasts.  It consists of a labyrinth and a central room 
containing Shyssiryxius and the treasure.  The entire cave is 
submerged, so ordinarily some means of water breathing and the 
swimming skill are required.  The most common method of obtaining 
water breathing is through a helm of water breathing (generally a 
"blue helmet" before identification).  Wearing two cursed  or one 
blessed rings of the fish also grants this; remember they are 
autocursing.  If the PC is not born with the Swimming skill, it 
can be obtained from Blup by giving him potions of carrot juice. 
Swimming is not required but probably increases movement speed 
underwater. The need for these abilities ordinarily keeps low 
level PCs out of the lair, which is as it should be.  The aquatic 
beasts found in the labyrinth are not trivial, especially dragon 
turtles and water elementals. Sharks and giant eels can also be 
found. None of these monsters see invisible<p>

In theory a PC with on demand teleportation, some regeneration or 
spenseweeds could survive a teleport to Shyssiryxius, a chat and 
a teleport to the up stairs without water breathing or Swimming. 
Drowning damage seems to be dependent on HPs, with high-HP PCs 
taking proportionally <i>more</i> damage. <p>

There are two main reasons for entering.  The first is to 'C'hat 
with Shyssiryxius then return to Terinyo.  This allows the PC to 
inform Blup about the location of his mother, which results in 
eventual delivery of the rune-covered trident, a decent artifact 
weapon and missile, later in the game.  The trident is delivered 
not long after reaching character level 16 for PCs born in the 
Raven starsign.  Others have to wait until level 36.  The location 
of the lair is not decided until the PC starts searching for it, 
so it is more or less possible to place it in a convenient location, 
such as near Terinyo.<p>

The second reason for entering the lair is to loot it.  There are 
occasionally outstanding items found in the treasure hoard.  As 
might be expected, Shyssiryxius does not take kindly to thieves 
and will attack. She does not see in Darkness, however. Cast 
Darkness over desired item(s), pick them up and leave.<p>

Note that delivery of the rune-covered trident is guaranteed once 
the PC informs Blup of Shyssiryxius' location.  The PC may then 
proceed to loot the cave, or indeed even kill Shyssiryxius without 
forfeiting the rune-covered trident.<p>

Monsters tamed in the underwater cave can leave with the PC and 
breathe air. This is probably a game bug.<p>


<b>2.13.1 Shyssiryxius</b><p>

Under normal circumstances, Shyssiryxius is not hostile, only 
intimidating.  If she is 'C'hatted with, she roars "HAST YE SEEN 
MY BABY?" (or "*DIE*" if the PC has done something to make her 
hostile).  Whether she is hostile or not, the PC can leave after 
chatting and report back to Blup.  This of course assumes a PC 
facing her when she is hostile survives (see below).  If the PC 
attempts to steal from her treasure hoard, she gives a warning 
about not picking anything up.  If the PC persists, she will attack.  
She is a formidable opponent with a reasonably powerful melee attack 
and a deadly water breath attack that is capable of dealing circa 
400 points of damage in a single round.  Sources of water breathing 
will reduce the damage of this attack. She regenerates and is 
immune to cold.  She is capable of teleporting and does so when 
she panics, making the PC work to find her while remaining 
underwater the whole time.  She can be killed, but it takes an 
upper level PC, and it doesn't hurt to have some blessed potions 
of extra healing along.  Note that Shyssiryxius, like certain other 
powerful monsters, is unable to fight in Darkness unless panicked. 
She is also vulnerable to poison.<p>
