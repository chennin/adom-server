<H3>Introduction</H3><p>

The ADOM Guidebook is intended to be a definitive reference for ADOM and 
as such contains spoilers throughout.  There is no provision made to 
protect newer players from spoilers, so if you want to figure out the game 
for yourself, this guide is not appropriate.<p>

The Guidebook started as simply ASCII, but has been expanded to take 
advantage of the more advanced features that HTML offers.  HTML and ASCII 
compilations are available for download and offline reference.  The ASCII 
compilation is circa 2005 and therefore contains errors and omissions.  A 
newer version may someday be generated but is a low priority.<p>

There are archives of the 1.0.0 and gamma 16 prerelease 2 versions available 
in <A HREF = "adomgb-app-N.html">Appendix N</A>.<p>

The historical work on the Guidebook was done by the Usenet newsgroup 
rec.games.roguelike.adom but today most players frequent 
<A HREF="http://www.adom.de/">Thomas Biskup's official ADOM site</A>.<p>
