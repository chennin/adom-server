<A NAME=0.14.0></A><b>0.14.0 Darkness</b><p>

Thanks to gut for this section.<p>

Darkness is one of the most useful options available to all literate PCs, yet it's one of the most underused. I can't count the number of players that say that they never even bothered with trying it.<p>

Monsters that can't see in Darkness will allow the PC to pound them to death without retaliation. The only exception is for monsters that are capable of panic. These monsters will be able to hit the PC when in a state of panic, but <i>only</i> if they do not have an escape route. For this reason, it's best to avoid using Darkness in a narrow corridor, because stray monsters can easily cut off the escape path of a powerful monster that is capable of killing the PC with one hit.<p>

<i>No</i> giant can see in Darkness, most humanoids also can't, with the notable exceptions of trolls, orcs, minotaurs, and dark elves. This is especially important to remember against tough monsters such as ogre magi (yes, even the arena champion kind). Vortices, mimics and several other early-game PC killers are all helpless in Darkness and vortices aren't even capable of panic.<p>

There is a bug in the game that keeps Darkness from working properly on door squares. It is important to mention that the PC is perfectly safe to use Darkness if the <i>PC</i> is on the door square, but not if the <i>monster</i> is on the door square.<p>

Other monsters that are known to see in Darkness (thanks mike):<p>

all balors<br>
all molochs<br>
all red dragons<br>
all undead<p>

<A NAME=0.14.1></A><b>0.14.1 Recharging wands</b><p>

There are many ways to recharge a depleted wand. The common ways are to dip the wand 
into an appropriate potion or read a scroll of charging.  Only the type of potion and 
its status affects the number of charges. The type, status and rusty/nonrusty nature of 
the wand do not matter.<p>

See the table below for some results compiled by Petri Sihvola:<p>

<table border=1>

</table><p>

Remember that a potentially endless supply of booze is available from beggars in 
Lawenilothehl. Give them 50 gold pieces, then 'C'hat with them and they will often 
drop a potion of booze. Only one per beggar, though, so those who have given up 
their potion need to be killed (alignment hit) or led into the wilderness to encourage 
more beggar generation. Get rid of all the other random monsters in the town to further 
encourage monster generation.<p>

Potions of raw mana and potions of potential mana do <i>not</i> work.  Note that potions 
of mana can be used to permanently increase the PCs mana stat; the player may want to 
save them for that purpose.<p>

Wizards can also recharge wands at level 32, only once per wand though.<p>

Wands of wishing can't be recharged. For these, you'll want to use the chance to wrench 
a final charge from the wand, destroying it.<p>

See also potions of raw chaos below.<p>


<A NAME=0.14.2></A><b>0.14.2 Huge rocks and anvils</b><p>

These heavy items have a nice use: crashing doors. Throw one at a door and
enjoy the sight of a broken door.  This is not guaranteed; it seems to be 
Strength dependent.  There is a very nice side benefit to this: any trap 
that the door was protected with is destroyed along with the door.  The 
trap does not go off as it is destroyed.  <p>

In addition, huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping anthills. 
Whenever an ant wants to escape, a message is generated: "The uncursed huge 
rock (-10, 10d6) seems to be shaking.". Eventually the huge rock is destroyed 
("Something from below destroys the uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!") 
and ants can come out of the hole again. Sometimes this happens after 
only a few turns, sometimes it takes more than a hundred. Multiple huge 
rocks are destroyed one after the other and thus last longer than a 
single one.<p>


<A NAME=0.14.3></A><b>0.14.3 Statues</b><p>

If your PC is really, really buff, a statue can be wielded as a melee 
weapon, but the real use for statues is to kick it until it breaks down, 
making it yield a magical wand. Statues can be generated by petrifying 
enemies. If a PC has a PV below four, he will take damage from kicking 
statues (and walls).<p>

Stephen White has done some research on the b/u/c status of statues 
regarding wand generation.  His PC kicked 200 statues with each status 
to pieces.  The results were as follows:<p>

Blessed statues: 62 wands generated, about 1/3<br>
Uncursed statues: 17 wands generated, about 1/10<br>
Cursed statues: 3 wands generated, about 1/100<p>


<A NAME=0.14.4></A><b>0.14.4 Potions of raw chaos</b><p>

Items can be dipped in potions of raw chaos in order to transform them
into new ones.  Dipping items (other than artifacts) into a PoRC will 
transform it into a random item of the same type - useful for brass items.
Equipped items are removed (even if cursed) and cursed.  There is a chance 
of spilling the potion, though, which corrupts the PC. Worse is the 
possibility of transforming an item into the exact same item. This causes 
an explosion which badly corrupts the PC, about 4 corruptions, and causes 
~250 HP of damage.  Needless to say, this can kill a low-level PC.  Never 
drink these!<p>

PoRC will only create items of a danger level that corresponds to the
level on which you dip the item. That means that dipping an amulet of 
free action on D:2 is free from explosion chances, and will give a risk 
free chance of creating an amulet of life saving. Consider carefully 
before trying this. The chance is small and amulets of free action can 
save the PC's life.<p>

Wands dipped into a PoRC will turn into a wand with a different
number of charges. This is one way to recharge wands with 0 charges
left.  The type of wand, however, is unpredictable.<p>

A heap of items that are dipped into a potion of raw chaos will always 
transform into a <i>single</i> item.

Potions of raw chaos can be created by dipping any corrupting artifact (those 
containing the essence of chaos and corruption + Moon Sickle) into any ordinary 
potion.<p>


<A NAME=0.14.5></A><b>0.14.5 Potions of exchange</b><p>

In addition to swapping stats, these can polymorph monsters when thrown. 
Blessed potions can polymorph items to another of the same type. The item 
produced will be appropriate for the danger level where the dipping takes 
place. This is the basis of ring-based wish engines. Once one has blessed 
potions of exchange stacks of 19 rings can be dipped, potentially producing 
19 rings of djinni summoning.  These in turn are enough to produce 57 more 
potions of exchange on average. Since used rings of djinni summoninng become 
brass rings, additional rings do not have to be wished for. The PC may have 
to throw in some wishes for potions of water to keep blessing the potions 
of exchange.  Of course once the engine starts there are enough spare wishes 
to actually get some things that matter as well. :-)<p>

<A NAME=0.14.6></A><b>0.14.6 Regeneration of HP and PP: potions of troll blood and raw mana</b><p>

When drinking potions of insight or casting the Revelation spell, there
is some information about Power Point and Hit Point regeneration.<p>

Those two values lie between 5 and 200: the lower the number, the faster the
regeneration. They can be affected by drinking potions of troll blood (for 
hit points) or potions of raw mana (for power points). Their effectiveness 
depends on their blessed/uncursed/cursed status:<p>
<table border=1>
<th align=left width=35%>Potion status</th><th align=left width=50%>Modification to regeneration rate</th>
<tr><td>blessed<td>-8 (on average, effect varies)
<tr><td>uncursed<td>-4 (on average, effect varies)
<tr><td>cursed<td>+4 (on average, effect varies)
</table>
<p>
Bottom line: always bless your potions of troll blood or raw mana.<p>

<b>HP regeneration time</b><p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>standard value (humans and hurthlings):<td>&nbsp;50
<tr><td>Dark Elves:<td>+20
<tr><td>Gray Elves:<td>+15
<tr><td>High Elves:<td>+10
<tr><td>Gnomes:<td>-2
<tr><td>Dwarves:<td>-5
<tr><td>Orcs:<td>-10
<tr><td>Drakelings:<td>-20
<tr><td>Trolls:<td>-30
<tr><td>Healers:<td>halved
<tr><td>most characters:<td>-1 (based on Toughness?)
<tr><td>some characters:<td>-1 once more (based on Toughness?)
</table>
<p>
The modifiers are applied in the order listed here.
E.g. Trollish Healers with exceptional toughness get a starting
regeneration time of (50 - 30) / 2 - 1 - 1 = 8.<p>

It seems like the last -1 modifiers are based on toughness, but there
does not seem to be an obvious relationship; a random element may be 
involved.<p>

<b>PP regeneration time</b><p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>standard value (humans and hurthlings):<td>&nbsp;50
<tr><td>Trolls:<td>+50
<tr><td>Dwarves:<td>+40
<tr><td>Hurthlings:<td>+10
<tr><td>Orcs:<td>+5

<tr><td>Dark Elves:<td>-20
<tr><td>Gray Elves:<td>-25
<tr><td>most characters:<td>-1 (based on Mana?)
<tr><td>some characters:<td>-1 once more (based on Mana?)
</table>
<p>

<b>How regeneration works</b><p>

The PC always receives one HP/PP once the appropriate time has passed. 
Healing/Concentration will regenerate additional points at random 
intervals.<p>

Regenerative capabilities from these sources are additive.<p>


<b>HP gained by Healing in 100 turns (approximately):</b><p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>no Healing:<td>0
<tr><td>Skill Level 10<td>0.8
<tr><td>Skill Level 20<td>1.6
<tr><td>.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>Skill Level 100<td>8.0
</table>
<p>

<b>HP gained naturally in 100 turns:</b><p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>standard character (1 HP/50):<td>2.0
<tr><td>1 HP/40:<td>2.5
<tr><td>1 HP/30:<td>3.3
<tr><td>1 HP/20:<td>5.0
<tr><td>1 HP/10:<td>10.0
<tr><td>1 HP/5:<td>20.0
</table>
<p>
As can be seen, many blessed potions of troll blood will get you more
than good Healing skill, but having Healing at 100 is best.<p>

The effect of the Candle starsign is two HP gained for 
every twelve turns.  This is faster than the Healing skill at 100.<p>

For regaining PP naturally, the same values apply. However, Concentration 
is better than Healing since it grants more points than Healing.  The value 
is also increased even more at specific points mentioned in the manual. 
Since there does not seem to be an obvious model for this, the values are 
simply listed:<p>

<b>PP gained by Concentration in 100 turns (approximately):</b><p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>no Concentration:<td>&nbsp;0
<tr><td>Skill Level 50:<td>10.96
<tr><td>Skill Level 74:<td>13.84
<tr><td>Skill Level 75:<td>26.86 x2
<tr><td>Skill Level 89:<td>32.42
<tr><td>Skill Level 90:<td>43.18 x4/3
<tr><td>Skill Level 99:<td>46.48
<tr><td>Skill Level 100:<td>59.00 x5/4
</table>
<p>
So potions of raw mana are nice, but not as important as having a high
Concentration skill.<p>

There don't seem to be any corruptions influencing mana regeneration.
Neither mana battery nor close attunement to astral space have any effect.<p>

Regeneration occurs at the same rate whether walking around or resting. 
Regeneration time is measured in <i>turns</i> (at least for simple actions like 
walking, fighting or resting), not game time. High speed or seven league 
boots lead to exactly the same regeneration rate in turns. Thus regeneration 
is faster with respect to game time if the PC is fast or walking around with 
seven league boots. If a PC with low walking energy cost wants to spend the 
minimum amount of game time regenerating, the best bet is to walk around 
while regenerating.<p>

The Cursed, Doomed, Lucky and Fate Smiles intrinsics do not make a
difference for regeneration purposes.<p>

Hunger status has no effect on regeneration.<p>

Trolls have food consumption doubled.<br>
Monks have food consumption halved.<br>
Farmers have food consumption halved starting from level 12.<p>

Things that are still missing and interesting to investigate:<p>
· Information about corpses (trolls are below for HP regeneration, maybe some creatures for PP regeneration)<br>
· the effect of items (such as necklaces of rapid healing)<br>
· the effect of the corrupted tissue corruption<br>
· the effect of being burdened/strained/very strained/overburdened on regeneration and food consumption<br>
· the effect of artifacts carried and worn on food consumption<br>
· information about the various special rooms that affect regeneration<p>

<b>0.14.6.1 Troll corpses</b><p>

Thanks to Malte Helmert for this section.<p>

There are four types of troll corpses (troll, troll berserker, troll 
chief, troll king). They all yield either of two messages when eaten by 
a non-troll:<p>

a) "Urg! Foul meat! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"<br>
b) "Urg! Foul meat!"<p>

Message a) indicates that HP regeneration time decreased by one<br>
Message b) indicates that HP regeneration time did not change<p>

For troll PCs, the messages are slightly modified:<p>

a') "Yum! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"<br>
b') "Yum!"<p>

The behaviour is the same: a' decreases HP regeneration time, b' does not.<p>

No corpse can reduce the regeneration time below 6. Trying this always 
gives message b) or b'), respectively. This differs from potions of 
troll blood, which always result in the "Your blood suddenly courses 
faster..." message, even if the regeneration time is already minimal. 
Note that the lower threshold is 6, unlike the threshold for potions of 
troll blood, which is 5. This means that trolls, who cannot make use of 
potions of troll blood, cannot lower their regeneration time to 5, 
unlike the other races.<p>

The probabilities of getting a decrease in regeneration time depends 
only on the B/U/C status of the corpse. Specifically, it does not 
depend on:<p>
· Current regeneration time (no difference between the lowest 
eligible value 7 and the unrealistically high value 300)<br>
· PC race (human vs. troll)<br>
· Cooked/uncooked status<br>
· Type of troll corpse (troll, troll berserker, troll chief, troll king)<p>

Results indicate that blessed corpses work in 100% of the cases 
(although, like all corpses, they cannot lower it below 6), and uncursed 
or cursed corpses work in 50% of the cases. There was no observable 
difference between uncursed and cursed corpses:<p>

94 blessed troll corpses: 94x decrease<br>
621 uncursed troll corpses: 314x decrease, 307x no decrease<br>
361 cursed troll corpses: 187x decrease, 174x no decrease<p>

There was no difference in weight or satiation value of the various kinds 
of troll corpses. All corpses weigh 240s if not cooked, irrespective of 
B/U/C (rotting) status, and 228s (= 5% less) if cooked, again irrespective 
of B/U/C (rotting) status.<p>

An uncursed corpse yields 500 units of satiation (like a large ration). 
This is doubled if the corpse is cooked (presumably this holds for other 
corpses too, but this needs further verification). The resulting value 
is modified by +25% for blessed corpes and -50% for cursed corpses, just 
like for other food items. So, e.g. a blessed cooked troll chief corpse 
gives 500 × 2 × 1.25 = 1250 units of satiation.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Item: [troll/troll berserker/troll chief/troll king] corpse<br>
Weight: 240s (-5% if cooked)<br>
Nutritional value: 500 (×2 if cooked, ×1.25 if blessed, ×0.5 if cursed)<br>
Effect when eaten [blessed]: If HP regeneration time is >= 7, it is 
reduced by 1<br>
Effect when eaten [uncursed/cursed]: If HP regeneration time is >= 7, it 
is reduced by 1 with a probability of 50%<br>
Message when eaten [non-troll PC]: "Urg! Foul meat!"<br>
Message when eaten [troll PC]: "Yum!"<br>
Additional message if and only if HP regeneration time was reduced: 
"Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"<p>


<A NAME=0.14.7></A><b>0.14.7 Freezing water</b><p>

Pretty straightforward: use some cold source while standing next to 
a water square and zap over it. Frost/Nether Bolt, Ice Ball/Freezing 
Fury, or a wand of cold qualify. Ice is fragile, of course, and 
there's a 2000 stone limit for your stuff's weight.  Exploding ice 
vortices will freeze all water in the range of their blast.  Likewise, 
monsters that cast Frost Bolt, Ogre Magi for instance, can freeze water.  
However, monsters that breathe ice, white dragons for example, do not 
freeze anything when their breath crosses water (probably a bug).<p>


<A NAME=0.14.8></A><b>0.14.8 Safe places to store items</b><p>

<b>The top line of the Terinyo map</b><p>

Under normal circumstances, the only monster in Terinyo that can step 
on the top line is the sheriff, and he can easily be lured to the first 
level of the puppy cave. It is then 100% secure. Skriek can step on the 
top line as well, if the PC lures him there. If the PC has committed an 
act which causes the town to become hostile, <i>any</i> inhabitant can 
enter the top row. If the PC has managed to save Khelavaster and he has 
returned to Terinyo, he can enter the top row.<p>

<b>Locked rooms</b><p>

Locked rooms are one of the safest places to leave items in ADOM.  
With the current state of the monster inventory system (they can 
pick up items but not use them), a monster will never be able to 
unlock a door.  Several monsters can smash doors, however.  Some 
monsters (balors spring to mind) can teleport into locked rooms.<p>

<b>The Old Barbarian's glade</b><p>

The Old Barbarian's glade is a decent place to store items.  He is 
the only monster ever generated in this location, so nothing randomly 
generated is going to run away with the PC's stuff.  If the PC leaves 
items far away from the Old Barbarian, he will not have time to find 
them prior to the PC's next visit.<p>

<b>The Mad Minstrel's clearing</b><p>

In ADOM 1.0.0+, the Mad Minstrel will leave his hut, and will pick up 
items.  The safety re storage is therefore similar to the Old 
Barbarian's glade.  No other monsters are generated in his clearing,
so leaving items far away from the Mad Minstrel should not allow him 
time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.<p>

<b>The Dwarven Mystic's room in Dwarftown</b><p>

The ultimate in security, if the PC has not destroyed it with a wand 
of destruction (see section 2.5.4).  After 'C'hatting wih the Dwarven 
Mystic, he disappears, leaving a 2 x 2 room that cannot be entered 
except by teleportation.  Since there are no teleporting monsters 
found in Dwarftown (except for the greater daemon - kill it) this is 
as safe as storage areas get.  Other Dwarftown inhabitants  can, in 
extremely rare circumstances, be generated in this room.  Since they 
will be nonhostile, killing them is not a good idea.  Teleport them 
out if possible.  Alternatively, use the Ogre Cave (see below).<p>

<b>The Ogre Cave in Dwarftown</b><p>

Once the Ogre Cave is cleared, monster generation there is slow or 
nonexistent.  Items can be left adjacent to the stairway.  If the PC 
leaves immediately, no time passes on the level, so there should be 
almost no chance the items will be disturbed.<p>

<b>The secret room in the HMV</b><p>

Another room accessible only by teleportation, therefore almost 
perfect theoretical security.  A monster teleporting into this 
room has never been seen.  In extremely rare circumstances, however, 
monsters can be generated in this room.  They may well be hostile, 
so killing them is a simple solution.  Teleporting them out is a 
worthwhile alternative.<p>

<b>Sharad-Waador's room</b><p>

Items left in Sharad-Waador's room never seem to be disturbed.  
Sharad-Waador never moves from the square where he is initially 
generated (unless he is attacked or the PC reneges on the deal to 
take the quest), and no time passes on the level between the PC's 
departure and reemergence from the blue dragon caves.  This is very 
important, since the player may want to leave important non-artifact 
equipment behind in order to avoid its potential destruction in the 
blue dragon caves (see section 3.9).<p>


<A NAME=0.14.9></A><b>0.14.9 Seven league boots</b><p>

Seven league boots can dramatically reduce the time needed to walk around
in the wilderness, depending on their blessed/uncursed/cursed status:<p>

blessed: time needed for walking is divided by 6<br>
uncursed: time needed for walking is divided by 3<br>
cursed: time needed for walking is multiplied by 2<p>

Blessed/uncursed/cursed seven league boots also alter the base energy cost 
for movement outside the wilderness from 1000 to 500/750/1500, respectively. 
The Long Stride talent stacks, reducing base energy cost further. 
Seven league boots should be blessed immediately.  They enable the PC to 
outrun anything other than quicklings.  Consequently, some players regard 
seven league boots as the most important item in the game, and will use a 
wish to obtain them, if necessary.<p>


<A NAME=0.14.10></A><b>0.14.10 Stethoscopes</b><p>

'U'sing a stethoscope, you can determine a monster's statistics
precisely. Furthermore, using a stethoscope, you can easily find secret
doors: scan a wall block, and if it "sounds hollow", it's a secret door.<p>

In addition to monsters and secret doors, stethoscopes can also be used on closed 
doors to find out the number of monsters behind it. The messages are:<p>

"Silence." - corridor (this message is shown even if the corridor is full of 
monsters, so be warned)<p>

"You hear nothing." - empty room<p>

"You hear some low-volume sounds." - 1 monster in the room<p>

"You hear some sounds." - 2-3 monsters<p>

"You hear many sounds." - 4-8 monsters<p>

"You hear lots of sounds." - 9 or more monsters (tension rooms and rooms filled 
with breeders or summoned creatures also give this message)<p>

See section 0.14.11 below concerning a Healer's special ability with stethoscopes.<p>


<A NAME=0.14.11></A><b>0.14.11 Undocumented character abilities</b><p>

All characters gain to-hit and to-damage bonuses when fighting as a true 
berserker, which means no armor can be worn and Tactics must be set to 
berserk.  Shields and bracers are acceptable, other armor is not.  Level 
40 and higher barbarians get additional bonuses on top of this when 
fighting as a true berserker.<p>

Note that Monks do not seem to receive this true berserker bonus.<p>

Monks gain the ability to kick down walls at experience level 13.<p>

There is a game bug in the Elementalist level 6 class power. They do not 
receive fire resistance. However, they are usually born with a ring of 
fire resistance.<p>

Merchants always specialize in a certain item: potions, rings, scrolls, 
or wands.  This specialization allows them to identify any item in that 
category on sight.<p>

Thanks gut for the details below on merchants' coin throwing ability:<p>

Merchants also have a unique ability to use coins as missile weapons 
(in ADOM 1.0.0+, dopplegangers cannot deflect a merchant's thrown coins). 
The coin throw action costs 1200 energy points as opposed to the normal 
1000. Getting the quick shot talent does apply to the coin throw attack, 
bringing it to 1080. The coin throw attack is not capable of receiving 
weapon marks, nor does it benefit from the strong thrower talent. The 
archery talent is not trained by coin throwing. Coin throwing does benefit 
from a high dexterity stat, rings of slaying, archery gloves, the good 
shot talent, the keen shot talent, the quick shot talent, the missile 
weapon master talent, and the find weakness skill. Coin throw attacks 
start out with a range of only 3, but at exp. level 10, it increases to 5, 
and increases a further +2 with each 10 experience levels gained.<p>

Healers have the ability to use a stethoscope without consuming any game 
time.  All other classes consume one turn of game time when using a 
stethoscope.<p>

Archers have a unique ability to dodge missiles. When a missile misses 
any other class PC, it simply stops at the PC's square. Missiles often 
fly past archers. This is actually probably undesirable since archers 
want to pick up those missiles, but it is nevertheless an undocumented 
unique ability.<p>

<A NAME=0.14.12></A><b>0.14.12 The weight and appearance of objects</b><p>

Note the weight of objects.  Many valuable objects have a unique weight.  
For instance, there is only one type of sword with a weight of 35s, one 
amulet weighing 7s, one amulet weighing 8s, one girdle weighing 30s, etc.  
In general, lighter items are better.  Items with odd, unusual or rare 
weights are often better than their more commonly observed counterparts.<p>

Certain special items are also have a unique color.  Slaying quarrels will 
be brown rather than the silver of normal quarrels.  Metal-shod quarterstaves 
(whether iron-, mithril-, adamantium- or eternium-) are silver; normal 
quarterstaves are brown.  This is especially important to remember for 
eternium-shod quarterstaves, since they have the same weight as wooden 
quarterstaves.<p>

138. They say that you need a lot of leverage to stop the forces of Chaos.<p>

Two levers, actually.<p>

139. They say that you need a strong will to enter the great rift.<p>

True (see section 2.22).<p>

140. They say that you need persistence and peace to truly profit from religious scriptures.<p>

The PC must be a champion of Order or Balance.<p>

167. To be heavy is not very nifty in a deep rift.<p>

Even worse than normal.<p>

168. Ye dost not need to find some kind of amulet to save the world.<p>

Reference to the original Rogue and its descendants.<p>

There are of course Ancardian day and date effects as well, which are well covered in the manual. One Ancardian time effect not mentioned is the fact that the PC's range of sight depends on the time of day in wilderness squares. In the morning (which apparently begins at 6h), the PC sees further, and in the evening (which apparently begins at 22h) the PC's sight is limited to 2 squares. The farsight spell seems to negate this.<p>

Known bugs with the Talent system:<p>

The Good Learner talent grants an experience of 40% rather than the stated 2%.  The Great Learner talent gives a net experience gain of ~20%.  So Good Learner alone is much better than Great Learner.<p>

The combination of Quick Shot and Lightning Shot reduces missile energy attack costs by 27.6%. This is more than the stated 2 × 10%.<p>

The Skilled talent causes the game to crash.  Do not select it.<p>

   --- STARTING TALENTS --- (all these have a prerequisite of Level 1)

Note that you only start with 1-6 talents. Since several of the
STARTING TALENTS are prerequisites, you need to consider your choice 
of Level 1 talents very carefully. Since a +Attribute talent is 
worth half a (blessed) potion of Attribute, it's probably only
worthwhile to take them as prerequisites if needed. Some +Attribute
talents, however, can be quite useful for early-game survival, and
should be considered.

   ALERT -- +1 to Perception.
   Prerequisites: Level 1. 

Rating: 3 (4 for archers)
Prerequisite for: Treasure Hunter(9), Missile Weapon Master(3-7)

Prerequisite for Missile Weapon Master and Treasure Hunter. Treasure
Hunter is generally accepted to be one of the most desirable (if not
_the_ most desirable) talents, making Alert a populer Level 1 choice.
See Missile Weapon Master for a discussion on viability.
If you don't want Treasure Hunter or Missile Weapon Master, Alert is
of marginal utility; Perception is one of the less useful attributes,
and is fairly easily increased. A mid-range Perception score (12-18)
is a prerequisite for a number of talents, none of them very useful,
except possibly Great Book Caster.
Note that this talent is slightly more useful if you play ADOM on 
higher than 80x25 resolutions.

   CHARMING -- +1 to Charisma.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 1 (2 for male characters and Bards)
Prerequisite for: Heir(3-10)

Prerequisite for Heir. If you don't have at least 3 starting talents,
or if you simply don't want Heir, this talent is next to useless.
While Charisma is not particularly easy to raise, it's almost 
completely useless for everyone except Bards (for whom it is of
medium importance).
Charisma is a prerequisite for Silver Tongue and Natural Trader,
neither of which is worth getting, either.

   DEXTROUS -- +1 to Dexterity.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 3

Not a prerequisite and probably not worth it. Dexterity gives speed, 
DV, and missile weapon to-hit (and possibly damage, anyone know for
certain?), but Dextrous is a dead-end talent and the specialized
talents for speed, DV, and missile bonuses are much more powerful.
Dexterity is the prerequisite for a number of useful talents. None 
of them need above 18 Dex, though, and that shouldn't be too 
difficult to come by in the early-to-mid game.

   FEY-BLOODED -- +1 to Mana.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 3 (2 for non-spellcasters)

Not a prerequisite. Of some use to spellcasters with low mana 
scores (troll wizards, for example). If your starting Mana score 
is low, this might be somewhat helpful in reaching the prerequisites 
for the magical talents. Since Mana is probably the easiest 
attribute to train, however, I'd advise against taking this talent.

   GOOD LOOKS -- +1 to Appearance.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 1 (2 for female characters)

Not a prerequisite, and a proufundly worthless talent. Appearance is 
the least useful attribute for anyone.

   LEARNED -- +1 to Learning.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 4 (5 for illiterate characters)

Not a prerequisite, and fairly easy to train for most characters.
Learning does help with a good number of things, but if your 
character automatically gets the Literacy skill, probably not worth 
it. Even if he/she doesn't, 1 point is unlikely to make a difference.

   STRONG -- +1 to Strength.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 4 (5-7 for melee characters)

Not a prerequisite. Strength can be trained very quickly at low 
levels, but slows down somewhat later. It is also one of the most
useful attributes for most characters. For this reason, melee
characters might possibly want to consider this talent.

   STRONG OF WILL -- +1 to Willpower.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 3 (4 for Mindcrafters)
Prerequisite for: Melee Weapon Master(5-7), Saint(2)

Prerequisite for Melee Weapon Master (and Saint, which is next to
usealess). If you don't want Melee Weapon Master, Willpower is of
medium-to-high importance (high for spellcasters, medium for everyone
else). It's easy to raise into the twenties by the early-to-mid game
(if you know how), though, making Strong of Will a bad choice except 
as a prerequisite.

   TOUGH -- +1 to Toughness.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 4

Not a prerequisite. Would be a fairly good choice if there wasn't a
reliable method of raising Toughness into the mid-twenties by the
early-to-mid game. Still might be worth considering for characters 
with a very low starting toughness, but the defensive talents are
overall probably better for early survival.

   WEALTHY -- Three times the normal starting money.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.
 
   VERY WEALTHY -- Two times the normal starting money.
   Prerequisites: Wealthy, Level 1.

   FILTHY RICH -- Two times the normal starting money.
   Prerequisites: Very Wealthy, Level 1.

Rating: 1 (3 for Merchants)

These three talents are rather useless. All three of them 
together will only get you twelve times your starting money 
(or 24 times, with Boon to the Family), which only counts as 
a lot at the very beginning of the game. 
One exception: merchants with a lot of starting talents can 
actually get quite a lot of money with these talents, potentially
opening up several interesting options for them in the early game.
Overall, these talents are still probably a suboptimal choice.

   BOON TO THE FAMILY -- Twice normal starting money.
   Prerequisites: Level 1. 

Rating: 1
Prerequisite for: Heir(3-10)

A prerequisite for Heir. Otherwise even worse than Wealthy.

   HEIR -- Receives a special magical item inherited from his family.
   Prerequisites: Boon to the Family, Charming, Level 1. 

Rating: 3-10 (depending on class; 10 would be for Bards)

Has two prerequisites, which means you must have at least 3 starting
talents to get it. Its usefulness is strongly dependent on your class.
For Bards, the reward is approximately worth a Wish, and is one of
the most powerful items in the game. Heir gifts for other classes
will eventually become obsolete, but usually help with early-game 
survival a great deal. It's _three_ starting talents, though, so 
consider it carefully.

   SKILLED -- +2 to all initial skill values.
   Prerequisites: Learning 9+, Level 1.
 
   VERY SKILLED -- +3 to all initial skill values.
   Prerequisites: Skilled, Learning 12+, Level 1.

   EXTREMELY SKILLED -- +5 to all initial skill values.
   Prerequisites: Very Skilled, Learning 15+, Level 1.

Rating: 3

You can only get these talents if you have a decent Learning, 
which is precisely when you don't need them. At low levels,
skills go up fast. Leave these talents alone.
Note also that these talents are currently (ADOM 1.1.1) 
buggy and can crash the game if taken.

   LONG-LIVED -- the PCs life span is extended by 30%.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 1-5 (Depending on race; 1 for elves, 5 for trolls)

PCs with short life spans might want to consider this. 30% is
not a lot overall, but might just be the bonus that saves your
life against Ghost Lords. It's a dead-end talent, though, so
consider it carefully.

   --- MELEE TALENTS ---

   AFFINITY WITH AXES -- +2 to hit with axes.
  
   AFFINITY WITH CLUBS & HAMMERS -- +2 to hit with clubs and hammers.

   AFFINITY WITH DAGGERS & KNIVES -- +2 to hit with daggers and
      knives.

   AFFINITY WITH MACES & FLAILS -- +2 to hit with maces and flails.

   AFFINITY WITH POLEARMS -- +2 to hit with polearms.

   AFFINITY WITH SWORDS -- +2 to hit with swords.

   AFFINITY WITH WHIPS -- +4 to hit with whips.

   AFFINITY WITH STAVES -- +2 to hit with staves.

   AFFINITY WITH TWOHANDED WEAPONS -- +2 to hit with twohanded
      weapons.

Rating: 6 (5 for spellcasters)
Prerequisite for: Melee Weapon Master (5-7)

If you want Melee Weapon Master, you must take three of these.
Otherwise, I suggest waiting until you're sure about what weapon(s)
you want to use in the long run; otherwise, it's a wasted talent.
+2 to hit is not a lot, but with the new ADOM combat system, you 
can never have too much (or even enough) of a to-hit bonus, and 
every little bit helps. The +4 for whips is nice, but still doesn't 
make whips worthwhile, generally speaking.

   MELEE WEAPON MASTER -- +3 to hit and damage in melee combat.
   Prerequisites: At least 3 melee weapon affinities, Defensive
   Fighter, Strong of Will

Rating: 7 (5 for spellcasters)

This is a very expensive talent: it has 7 prerequisites. Still,
since four of them (with the exceptions being Strong of Will and
two of the three affinities) are useful for a melee fighter, it's 
probably worth getting.
For spellcasters, DV and PV are much more important than to-hit
and damage, which makes Melee Weapon Master a less attractive 
proposition.

   BRAWLER -- +2 to hit in unarmed melee combat.
   Prerequisites: Strength 13+.

Rating: 1 (7 for Monks and Beastfighters)

Not a prerequisite. If you're playing an unarmed fighter, 
probably worth getting.

   STRONG LEGS -- Kicking in doors is much easier. +2 to kick damage.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 1 (4 for Monks)

Not a prerequisite. Useless for anyone but monks; you very rarely
need to kick down a door quickly. Since not even Monks kick much,
even after getting the circular kick ability, and the damage bonus
is not at all spectacular, it's probably best to ignore this talent.

Note that this talent may or may not help with kicking down walls
quickly, for a Monk of level 13 or above.

   AGGRESSIVE -- +1 to hit in melee.

Rating: 5 (2 for spellcasters)
Prerequisite for: Natural Berserker (4-8)

If you want Natural Berserker, you must get this. If you don't, 
you'd probably be better off with other combat talents. +1 is
not much at all.

   NATURAL BERSERKER -- +2 to hit and damage when berserking.
   Prerequisites: Aggressive.

Rating: 4 (may be 6-8, depending on playstyle).

Normally, one doesn't usually spend much time in Berserk mode, and
this talent isn't powerful enough to justify doing so. If, however,
you play a berserkering melee fighter, this can be a fairly powerful
talent.

   AMBIDEXTROUS -- +2 to hit when fighting with two weapons.

Rating: 6

Not a prerequisite. Probably a good idea to get it if you're planning
on fighting with two weapons.

   BASHER -- +1 to hit and damage with weapons weighing more than 
      100 stones.

   POWERFUL STRIKE -- +2 to hit and damage with weapons weighing more
      than 100 stones.
   Prerequisites: Basher, Strength 13+.

   MIGHTY STRIKE -- +3 to hit and damage with weapons weighing more
      than 100 stones.
   Prerequisites: Powerful Strike, Strength 18+.

Rating: 9 (situational, 6 for spellcasters)

Unfortunately, most worthwhile weapons are 100s or lighter. Even with
these talents, the only weapons that are worthwhile are maces of 
destruction and some artifacts. Also, some weapons with the "heavier-
than-normal" prefixes, as well as some non-higher-metal ego weapons, 
might fit into this category.
If you actually manage to get one of these weapons, these talents can
be _very_ worthwhile. It's definitely a gamble, though, and none of
them can even be wished for, except the mace of destruction. For this
reason, I suggest only getting these talents if you've actually found
one of the above weapons, or you know you'll get it (quite a few of
the artifacts that fit the bill are guaranteed, including, notably,
the ToTRR). Getting these talents eariler is a very risky gamble.

   --- MISSILE AND THROWN WEAPON TALENTS ---

   AFFINITY WITH BOWS -- +2 to hit with bows.

   AFFINITY WITH CROSSBOWS -- +2 to hit with crossbows.

   AFFINITY WITH SLINGS -- +2 to hit with slings.

   AFFINITY WITH BOOMERANGS & SCURGARI -- +4 to hit with thrown
      boomerangs and scurgari.

   AFFINITY WITH THROWN DAGGERS -- +3 to hit with thrown daggers.

   AFFINITY WITH THROWN AXES & HAMMERS -- +3 to hit with thrown axes
      and hammers.

   AFFINITY WITH THROWN ROCKS & CLUBS -- +3 to hit with thrown rocks
      and clubs.

   AFFINITY WITH THROWN SPEARS -- +3 to hit with thrown spears.

Rating: 5 (4 for spellcasters, 7 for archers)
Prerequisite for: Missile Weapon Master(3-7)

If you want Missile Weapon Master, you must take three of these.
Otherwise, I suggest waiting until you're sure about what missile 
weapon(s) you want to use in the long run; otherwise, it's a wasted 
talent. Your to-hit bonus for missile weapons is less of a critical 
issue than for melee weapons, which is why these got a lesser score. 
For an archer, though, they're still very useful.

   GOOD SHOT -- +1 to hit and damage with missile weapons.

   KEEN SHOT -- +2 to hit and damage with missile weapons.
   Prerequisites: Good Shot, Dexterity 13+.

   EAGLE-EYED -- +3 to hit and damage with missile weapons.
   Prerequisites: Good Shot, Archery 80+, Dexterity 18+.

Rating: 6 (4 for spellcasters, 9 for archers)

These are excellent bonuses for an archer. Other characters will
want to consider how much they will be using missile weapons.
Note that Keen Shot is _not_ a prerequisite for Eagle-Eyed, just
for Missile Weapon Master. If you can, buy Eagle-Eyed first.

   MISSILE WEAPON MASTER -- +3 to hit and damage in missile combat.
   Prerequisites: At least 3 missile weapon affinities, Keen Shot,
   Alert

Rating: 5 (3 for spellcasters, 7 for archers)

This is the same as Eagle-Eyed, but much more expensive. It has 6
prerequisites, 3 of which (Alert and two of the three affinities)
are not very useful. Characters other than archers will probably
want to pass on this one.

   QUICK SHOT -- Missile attacks require 10% less energy.
   Prerequisites: Keen Shot, Quick.

   LIGHTNING SHOT -- Missile attacks require 10% less energy.
   Prerequisites: Quick Shot, Archery 60+.

Rating: 7 (9 for archers, 5 for pure spellcasters)

If you're planning on using missile weapons at all, the bonus
speed from these talents is excellent.

   FAR SHOT -- Missile attack ranges are increased by 20%.
   Prerequisites: Keen Shot, Strength 10+.

Rating: 2 (3 for archers)

If you're not going to be primarily using missile attacks, the
extra range isn't going to come into play much. If you are, then
you should have more than sufficient range from your weapon skill 
and the Archery skill. Avoid.

   STRONG THROWER -- +2 range with thrown weapons.
   Prerequisites: Strength 12+.

Rating: 2 (5 for throwers, 7 in special circumstances)

This is somewhat better than Far Shot (+2 range is usually better
than +20%; if not, then you really don't need to be increasing your
range anyway). It really becomes useful if you want to use unorthodox
throwing weapons like Hammer of the Gods or Long Sting. In those 
cases, the +2 range can actually be very useful. I suggest waiting
until you're sure that's what you want to do, and then considering
buying this talent.

   --- DEFENSIVE TALENTS ---

   CAREFUL -- +1 to DV.

Rating: 5 
Prerequisite for: Very Careful(4-7), Defensive Fighter(7), 
   Good Book Caster(5-8)

DV is very important for all classes in the mid-to-late game. +1 is
not much by itself, but Careful is a prerequisite for Very Careful, 
for the Defensive Fighter->Dodger chain, as well as for Good Book 
Caster. All great talents.

   VERY CAREFUL -- +3 to DV when fighting very defensively or like a
      coward.
   Prerequisites: Careful.

Rating: 4 (7 for spellcasters, may be 5-7 for others depending on
playing style)

Most players probably won't be fighting very defensively a lot, and 
this talent isn't good enough to make it worth doing so. If, however,
you're a spellcaster, or you generally fight at the Very Defensive
setting, this can be a useful bonus.

   DEFENSIVE FIGHTER -- +2 to DV.
   Prerequisites: Careful, Quick.

Rating: 7
Prerequisite for: Melee Weapon Master(5-7), Dodger(7)

+2 DV is nice for all classes. This is also a prerequisite for two
useful talents.

   DODGER -- +2 to DV.
   Prerequisites: Defensive Fighter, Dodge 75+

Rating: 7

Same as Defensive Fighter. Not a prerequisite for anything, though.

   SHIELD SPECIALIST -- +1 to DV when wielding a shield.

   SHIELD EXPERT -- +2 to DV when wielding a shield.
   Prerequisites: Shield Specialist, Shield Weapon Skill 3+

   SHIELD MASTER -- +3 to DV when wielding a shield.
   Prerequisites: Shield Expert, Shield Weapon Skill 6+

Rating: 7

These are only worth buying if you plan on getting all three. 
Otherwise, Careful and Defensive Fighter are probably better.
If you use a shield, though, these three give a +6 bonus to
DV, which is excellent.

   HARDY -- +3 hitpoints.
   Prerequisites: Toughness 10+.

Rating: 4
Prerequisite for: Very Hardy(4-7), Tough Skin(5-7)

Prerequisite for the 7 talents below. If don't want them, Hardy
probably isn't worth it; 3 hitpoints doesn't count for too much 
even in the early game, and quickly becomes negligible.

   VERY HARDY -- +6 hitpoints.
   Prerequisites: Hardy, Toughness 15+.

   EXTREMELY HARDY -- +9 hitpoints.
   Prerequisites: Very Hardy, Toughness 20+.

Rating: 4 (5-7 in the early game)

If you have a Toughness of 20 or more, 18 extra hitpoints aren't 
going to mean much, especially in the late game. Your talents would 
probably be better spent elsewhere. If you feel that the early game
is going to be the most difficult part for your character, though,
then these talents might just mean the difference between life and
death.

   TOUGH SKIN -- +1 to PV.
   Prerequisites: Hardy, Toughness 12+.
 
   IRON SKIN -- +1 to PV.
   Prerequisites: Tough Skin, Toughness 15+.
 
   STEEL SKIN -- +2 to PV.
   Prerequisites: Iron Skin, Toughness 20+.
 
   MITHRIL SKIN -- +3 to PV.
   Prerequisites: Steel Skin, Dwarf.

Rating: 7 (5 without Mithril Skin)

Debatable. With the current combat system, PV is not as useful as
DV in the mid-late game. If you want to be difficult to damage, 
you're better off using a shield and/or buying the DV talents. 
On the other hand, PV is much more important in the early game.
If you feel that your character is most vulnerable early on, you
might want to give these talents serious thought, even if you
can't get Mithril Skin.
It's a big chunk of your available talents, however; Steel Skin 
is 4 talents for +3 HP and +4 PV, and Mithril Skin is 5 talents 
for +3 HP and +7 PV.

   IMMUNE TO PAIN -- One point of damage is always negated for all
      attacks. At least one point of damage will be caused 
      nonetheless.
   Prerequisites: Iron Skin, Willpower 15+.

Rating: 5

This is like a point of super-PV, that applies to everything, always.
Unfortunately, it's a single point, and it's a dead-end talent.
Probably not worth it.

   --- MAGICAL TALENTS ---

   POTENT AURA -- +3 power points.
   Prerequisites: Mana 10+

Rating: 3 
Prerequisite for: Strong Aura(4-8), Strong Magic(3-6), Charged(4-7?),
   Strong Healer(4-7), Good Book Learner(4)

This talent is the prerequisite for every single MAGICAL TALENT. By
itself, though, it's not very useful; 3 power points are even less 
impressive a bonus than 3 hit points (see Hardy).

   STRONG AURA -- +6 power points.
   Prerequisites: Potent Aura, Mana 12+.

Rating: 4 
Prerequisite for: Mighty Aura(4-8), Durable Magic(3-4),
   Great Book Learner(4), Good Book Caster(5-8)

Again, not too impressive in itself, but the prerequisite for two
useful talents.

   MIGHTY AURA -- +9 power points.
   Prerequisites: Strong Aura, Mana 15+

Rating: 4 
Prerequisite for: Extended Magic(3-4), Great Book Caster(5-8)

Still not worth it by itself (the 18 mana given by this talent and 
its two prerequisites is a drop in the bucket for any serious
spellcaster), but it is the prerequisite for Great Book Caster
(an excellent talent), and Extended Magic (a not so excellent one)


   STRONG MAGIC -- +2 to all damage caused by spells.
   Prerequisites: Potent Aura, Mana 15+.

Rating: 3 (6 for pure spellcasters)

Not a prerequisite, but can be a useful talent for spellcasters. 
Unfortunately, +2 is not much at all.

   CHARGED -- Regenerates power points at higher speed.
   Prerequisites: Mana 16+, Potent Aura.

Rating: 4? (7? for pure spellcasters)

The rating for this talents depends on exactly _how_ much extra
PP regeneration it gives. If it's the same 20% you get for Healthy,
and it's added on _after_ Concentration bonuses, I'd give it a 
rating of 7 for pure spellcasters, 4 for everyone else. It's quite
good, but not quite good enough to be essential.
Note that in the latest version of ADOM (1.1.1), casting spells
from HP is not as good an idea as it use to be, since doing so
abuses the Mana attribute. This makes mana regeneration more 
useful than it used to be.

   DURABLE MAGIC -- all spell durations are increased by the PCs
      current level times 3.
   Prerequisites: Willpower 16+, Strong Aura.

Rating: 3 (4 for pure spellcasters)

Spells this applies to (presumably) are Bless, Slow Monster, 
Invisibility, Strength of Atlas, Farsight, and possibly Scare Monster.
That's not a lot, and most of these spells can simply be recast when
needed, making this a not-very-useful talent.

   EXTENDED MAGIC -- all spell ranges are increased by 2.
   Prerequisites: Mana 24+, Mighty Aura.

Rating: 3 (4 for pure spellcasters)

For bolt spells, a range increase of 2 also means a damage 
increase of 2, IIRC. For this reason and Death Ray, this could have
been a marginally useful talent. Unfortunately, for most spellcasters,
it's tough to get it in the early game, when bolt spells (and this 
talent) would be the most useful.
Note that this talent does _not_ increase the area of effect of ball
spells.

   STRONG HEALER -- +4 to all damage healed by spells.
   Prerequisites: Potent Aura, Willpower 15+.

Rating: 4-6 (7 for pure spellcasters)

This can be a good talent, and not just for pure spellcasters. Its
usefulness wanes in the late game, but early on, it boosts healing
spells by quite a bit. Most characters don't have to heal themselves
very often, but when they do, it's sometimes imperative that they
heal as fast as possible, which is why this talent is a potential
life-saver.

   GOOD BOOK LEARNER -- PC is 10% more effective when learning 
      spells from spell books.
   Prerequisites: Potent Aura, Good Learner.

   GREAT BOOK LEARNER -- PC is 10% more effective when learning 
      spells from spell books.
   Prerequisites: Good Book Learner, Strong Aura, Great Learner.

Rating: 4

These are just not very good. Together, they give 21%. If they gave
more than that, they could be useful for borderline-spellcasters, 
like paladins. 21% is just not a significant enough boost, though.

   GOOD BOOK CASTER -- Casting spells from books costs only double
      power points.
   Prerequisites: Careful, Strong Aura, Dexterity 14+.

   GREAT BOOK CASTER -- Casting spells from books costs only 50% more
      power points.
   Prerequisites: Good Book Caster, Mighty Aura, Dexterity 18+,
      Perception 15+.

Rating: 7-8 (5 for pure spellcasters)

These can be excellent talents, primarily _not_ for pure spellcasters
(who tend to get enough castings from books anyway, thank you very
much, and have enough mana to cast from books when they need to), but
for characters learning spells at low effectivity through various 
means, then casting the spells via books. Unfortunately, most of these
characters tend to wince at the 2-3 Aura talent prerequisites. Still,
these can definitely be worth considering.

   --- MISCELLANEOUS TALENTS ---
 
   GOOD LEARNER -- Learns very fast. +2% to all experience gained.
   Prerequisites: Learning 10+.
  
   GREAT LEARNER -- Learns extremely fast. +3% to all experience
      gained.
   Prerequisites: Learning 16+.
  
   Rating: 4 (5 for trolls)

Not quite good enough for serious consideration. +5% XP is never
enough for a single level, and spending two talents - 6 levels' 
worth! on this small amount of extra XP seems like a waste.
Charactes with very important class abilities, like Mindcrafters,
could find even this little bit of extra XP useful, but +5% is
just pitifully little.

   PORTER -- Carrying capacity is increased by 10% due to the PCs
      efficient packaging skills.
   Prerequisites: Strength 8+, Dexterity 10+.

   MASTER PACKAGER -- Carrying capacity is increased by 20% due to 
      the PCs efficient packaging skills.
   Prerequisites: Porter, Learning 12+, Perception 12+.

   BEAST OF BURDEN -- Carrying capacity is increased by 30% due to the
      PCs efficient packaging skills and great endurance. 
      Prerequisites: Master Packager, Willpower 12+, Toughness 12+.

Rating: 6 (8 for Monks)

These three talents together give a 71.6% bonus to carrying capacity.
This can be useful for most characters, and is especially critical 
for Monks, who can rarely afford even Burdened status.
If you want them, you should probably buy all three.

   LONG STRIDE -- Movement costs but 950 energy points.

Rating: 7

Faster movement is always good, and this is somewhat cumulative with
other bonuses. Also, unlike speed bonuses, it doesn't affect the XP
you get. Can be invaluable in the early game for outrunning cats (or
any other monster).

   QUICK -- +2 to Speed.

   VERY QUICK -- +3 to Speed.
   Prerequisites: Quick.

   GREASED LIGHTNING -- +4 to Speed.
   Prerequisites: Very Quick, Dexterity 15+.

Rating: 8

Speed is hard to come by, and a hefty +9 is probably worth the three
talents it costs. It does come with an XP hit, but not much.
Quick is also the prerequisite for Defensive Fighter and Quick Shot,
two great talents.

   HEALTHY -- Heals wounds 20% faster.

Rating: 6 (4 for spellcasters)

Anyone with easy access to healing spells will probably not need this
talent. If you're not a spellcaster, though, an extra 20% of natural 
healing can be handy in the early game, especially when you start
without the Healing skill. Later on, it's not that important, so buy
this talent early or not at all.

   SIXTH SENSE -- More easily evades traps.
   Prerequisites: Perception 18+.

Rating: ?

Unfortunately, does not say how _much_ more easily. This can 
potentially be very useful; traps can be a very nasty and unavoidable 
source of equipment destruction, and can even be a serious danger in
the early game.

   MECHANICALLY INCLINED -- All Disarm Traps checks are 10% easier.

Rating: 1

Absolutely useless. Disarm Traps is a low-priority skill in any case,
and 10% is nothing.

   MISER -- Tends to find more gold because he looks more intensely
      for it.

Rating: 4 
Prerequisite for: Treasure Hunter(9)

If you don't want to get Treasure Hunter, it's probably not a good 
idea to take Miser; gold is just not that difficult to come by in 
ADOM, and the easiest ways to get gold are unaffected by Miser.

   TREASURE HUNTER -- More monsters drop items when killed.
   Prerequisites: Alert, Miser

Rating: 9

Considered by many to be the best talent overall. Adds a chance for 
more monsters to drop items when killed. The quality of items is 
unaffected. Well worth the two prerequisites, in my opinion.
</pre>
[The value of this Talent vs its cost is hotly debated. Many players think that sacrificing two talents that might save the PC's life in the early game is not worth the increase in item generation. - AW]
<pre>

   SILVER TONGUE -- Shop prices are reduced by 10%.
   Prerequisites: Charisma 10+.

   NATURAL TRADER -- Shop prices are reduced by 20%.
   Prerequisites: Silver Tongue, Charisma 14+.

Rating: 3

Again, money is not much of an issue in ADOM, and a 32% drop in 
prices is just not that impressive.

   PIOUS -- Prayers are 5% less expensive.
   Prerequisites: Willpower 15+.

   VERY PIOUS -- Prayers are 5% less expensive.
   Prerequisites: Pious, Willpower 20+.

   SAINT -- Prayers are 5% less expensive.
   Prerequisites: Strong of Will, Very Pious, Willpower 30+.

Rating: 2

These three are ridiculously weak. Prayers being 16% cheaper is a 
very slight effect, and would probably not be very worthwhile even
as a single talent. As the sum of three talents, it's pathetic.
With all three talents, 6 prayers will still cost a bit more piety
than 5 prayers would for a person without these talents. Not 
exactly exciting news.

   SCOUT -- More likely to evade wilderness encounters. Less likely to
      be ambushed.
   Prerequisites: Dexterity 10+, Perception 13+.

Rating: 5 (3 for spellcasters)

Can be somewhat useful in the very early game. Until and unless the
uber-jackal effect is fixed, this can retain its usefulness for non-
spellcasters. Still not a worthwhile pick, though; any character past
level 20 ought to have a solution to wilderness ambushes.

   STEALTHY - All Stealth checks are 10% easier.

Rating: 3

This might be interesting if it gave 30% or more. Even then, you'd 
have to play a "stealthy" character to make use of the bonus, which 
would be fun, but not really powerful. As is, the effect of this
talent is negligible.

                          *** SUMMARY ***

anything that got a rating of 6 or above. Entries in brackets are
only worthwhile as prerequisites.

for a Melee Talent.

<A NAME=0.14.17></A><b>0.14.17 The final score</b><p>

The algorithm presented here is revised to reflect experiments conducted in April, 2008:<p>
<pre>
score = sum of all skill scores / 20 +
        spell memory [the first number] for each known spell / 5 + 50 +
        MIN(piety - 200, 10000000) +
        (level - 1) × 50 +
        experience / ~3.5 +
        (sum of the danger ratings [1-50] of explored levels) × 30 +
        (# identified items × 100) +
        various amounts for having intrinsics (between 200 and 10000 each) +
        ~2000 (retrieving the cute puppy) +
        20000 (making Blup happy) +
        (sum of attribute modifications × 200) +
        (# of successful dwarven quests × 5000) +
        5000 (if member of thieves guild) +
        5000 (if head of thieves guild) +
        1000 (adhering to the principles of the Cat Lord)
        250000 (saving Khelavaster) +
        2000000 (being a paragon of order) +
        MAX(0, 300 - max. hitpoints) × 1000 (only if the game was completed) +
        20000 (no divine interventions and game complete) +
        20000 (champion) +
        -10000 (fallen champion) +
        -(chaos score × 20) (typical about 1000 points score per corruption)

This score is doubled if you managed to solve the major goal of the
game.

If you managed to solve the game <i>and</i> leave the Drakalor Chain the
following is added to that score:

        MAX(0, 80000 - moves) × 1000

Then the score is once more doubled.
