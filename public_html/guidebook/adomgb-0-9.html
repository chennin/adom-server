<H3>Killing monsters</H3>

<b>0.9.1 The significance of the first kill</b><p>

Many new ADOM players are dismayed to find that they need to know what monster 
their PC killed first.  By the time they find this out, they have forgotten, of 
course.  Write it down, rename your PC to reflect your first kill, do anything 
necessary to remember that first kill.  It is very important, especially if you 
are going to attempt an ultra ending.<p>


<b>0.9.1.1 The Courage skill</b><p>

There is a description of the Courage skill in the ADOM manual.  It is 
worthwhile to acquire it, although many players ignore it and have finished the 
game without it.  The skill is obtained by finishing the Old Barbarian's quest: 
kill an additional score (20) of the monster your PC first killed.  Note that 
the Old Barbarian will not give the quest to PCs who have chaotic alignment.<p>


<b>0.9.1.2 The Filk quest</b><p>

The Filk quest is for very advanced players attempting an ultra ending.  The 
quest objective is to find and kill the named quickling bard Filk.  He can be 
found in the Infinite Dungeon on the level number corresponding to the number 
of first-kill monsters the PC has killed.  This will of course be a minimum 
of 21 if the PC has acquired the Courage skill.  It can also change during 
the quest if the PC kills additional first-kill monsters after being assigned 
the quest.  See section 4.3.1.1 for more about the Filk quest.<p>


<b>0.9.1.3 Strategy for the first kill: where and what?</b><p>

There are many schools of thought on what the first kill should be.  If the PC 
wants to acquire the Courage skill quickly after being assigned the Old 
Barbarian's quest, the monsters should be readily available.  If the PC 
also plans to do the Filk quest later in the game, the total number of 
first-killed monsters killed must be minimized in order to prevent a tedious 
and dangerous dive into the Infinite Dungeon.  Some experienced players will 
ignore the Old Barbarian's quest for the Courage skill.  This makes it very 
easy to complete the Filk quest, since if the player has chosen wisely the PC 
will have killed only one of the monsters in question.  Some players choose to 
make the first kill in Lawenilothehl for this reason.  Muggers, for instance, 
are found only in Lawenilothehl and the Assassins' Guild.  Skriek, the ratling 
found in Lawenilothehl, is the only cloaked ratling in the game (although killing 
him means the PC can no longer buy keys from him, which can save the PC's life).  
Hotzenplotz, who is also located in Lawenilothehl, is the only crime lord in the 
game.  He is not easy for an experience level one PC to kill, but it can be done 
with wizards who have a good offensive bolt spell (not Magic Missile), or 
hurthling archers who start the game with level five skill in thrown rocks.  
Hotzenplotz's guardians Grunge and Munge are likewise the only two half-orc 
bouncers in the game.<p>

If the PC wants the Courage skill and wants to attempt an ultra ending, the 
following requirements must be met: the first kill must be a monster readily 
available after receiving the Old Barbarian's quest; it must also be uncommon 
in the various dungeons the PC will face so that the Filk quest does not get 
out of control.  Entering the Small Cave at the start of the game and killing 
a rat, kobold or goblin as the first kill, for instance, makes it much more 
difficult to finish an ultra ending.<p>


<b>0.9.2 Cats - the significance of felines</b><p>

There are three types of monsters that count as cats in ADOM: cave lions, cave 
tigers and wild cats.<p>

The Cat Lord resides on D: 35 in the Caverns of Chaos. He rewards PCs who have 
avoided killing any cats with a powerful artifact ring. He will be hostile 
towards PCs that have killed cats and becomes more powerful with each cat killed.<p>

Many players consider the Ring of the Master Cat to be the most powerful and 
desirable ring in the game.  It grants +16 to Dexterity and +16 to speed.  In 
addition it causes the PC to deliver considerably more critical hits with melee 
and missile weapons and grants the Fate Smiles intrinsic.<p>

It is important to remember that even after receiving the ring, the PC must not 
kill any cats while wearing it, since it explodes in that circumstance.  The 
ring does not explode if it is in the backpack or left on another level when a 
cat is killed after receiving the RotMC.<p>

Make no mistake about it, the requirement to kill no cats for the entire game is 
a difficult one, causing many to refer to them as "those damn cats."  The power 
of the ring makes it worthwhile to attempt to avoid killing them.<p>

There are several ways to deal with cats.  Teleportation is one, from a wand or 
spell.  Either teleport the cat away, especially if the PC does not have teleport 
control, or teleport the PC.  Potions of exchange thrown at a cat will turn it 
into another monster.  Potions of raw chaos, available at any time once the PC has 
Moon Sickle, will turn cats into writhing masses of primal chaos when thrown at 
cats. Cats can be led over traps until they are killed or turned into a writhing 
mass of primal chaos.  Luring a cat across an alarm trap causes other monsters 
to become hostile and attack the cat. Note that in newer versions of ADOM, the PC 
is charged with killing a cat if he creates or sets off a trap that kills a cat. 
Wands of destruction can be used to safely kill cats since monsters "destroyed" 
in this way do not appear in the kill list.<p>

PCs that are near Dwarftown can bring cats to Dwarftown and have the Priest, for 
instance, kill them.  This is probably a bit dangerous, since bringing hostile 
monsters into Dwarftown repeatedly may eventually result in some of the inhabitants 
becoming hostile.  It should also be possible for PCs near the Banshee's level to 
bring cats to her level and have her wail kill them. Additional monsters that can 
be used include vortices.  Lure a cat close enough to one and allow it to explode. 
Be familiar with vortices before trying this.<p>

Companions can kill cats for you.  Cave lions and wild cats can be tamed with rat 
and/or giant rat (but not chaos rat) corpses, if you have enough of them.  Cave 
tigers can eventually be tamed with pieces of fresh and/or raw meat, but it 
requires five or more pieces. If the PC can become invisible, and has not attacked 
the cat in question, it can simply be walked away from.  Cats can be confused with 
the Ventriloquism skill. While they are confused, run away.  Cats can probably be 
confused or blinded by throwing potions of confusion or blindness at them.  Again 
the run away tactic would be used.<p>


<b>0.9.3 Karmic beings</b><p>

Karmic monsters come in three main varieties: karmic lizards, karmic dragons 
and ancient karmic dragons.  They can be identified by the fact that they 
change color with each turn.  Be very careful if the PC encounters a lizard 
with the 'w'alk command.  It may allow the PC to wind up right next to the 
lizard, in which case you may not have time to notice the color change.  
Karmics demand caution because attacking them in melee causes the PC to lose 
the Fate Smiles intrinsic, then the Lucky intrinsic followed by cursing then 
dooming if the PC continues.  This is not a 100% guaranteed effect.  PCs can 
kill karmics in one hit and not suffer the consequences.  However, it happens 
so often that karmics should not be engaged in melee if it is possible to 
avoid it.  Killing them with magic, missiles, mindcraft or companions is the 
way to dispatch them.  The changing color of karmics reflects the nature of 
karmic dragons.  They breathe not one element, like ordinary dragons, but have 
<i>all</i> the breath attacks available, varying from turn to turn depending on 
their color.  This also means that they are immune to all elemental magical 
attacks.  Unfortunately karmic dragon scale mail is not available in the game. 
;-)  They are vulnerable to dragon slaying ammo.<p>

There are such things as karmic wyrms.  There is one guaranteed in the game.  
Thankfully, he is not initially hostile.  Another being shares the 
cursing/dooming property of karmics: Filk, the quickling bard.<p>

Karmic beings will occasionally leave corpses when killed.  Eating the corpse 
of a karmic being will, in order, remove the doomed intrinsic if present, remove 
the cursed intrinsic if present, grant the Lucky intrinsic if not present and 
grant the Fate Smiles intrinsic if not present.  Remember all or any of these 
intrinsics can be present simultaneously.  Thus a PC that is doomed and Lucky 
would lose the doomed intrinsic and retain the Lucky intrinsic after eating a 
karmic corpse.  The same is true for a PC that has the cursed and doomed 
intrinsics - the PC would lose the doomed intrinsic but not the cursed intrinsic 
and would not gain either the Lucky or Fate Smiles intrinsics.<p>


<b>0.9.4 Dragons</b><p>

The various dragons have particular vulnerabilities noted in Appendix J.  
They have a unique characteristic when killed: a dragon that has picked 
up gold pieces will drop twice as many when killed, in addition to 
whatever gold and other treasure it may have been carrying.  This is 
probably a bug and can obviously be used to multiply the PC's gold 
potentially indefinitely once he is buff enough to dispatch dragons. 
Note that the amount of gold in a single stack is limited to a 32-bit 
integer (2^31 - 1 or 2,147,483,647).  Generating larger stacks will 
cause errors.<p>


<b>0.9.5 Strategies for dealing with particularly annoying monsters</b><p>

Suggestions for more annoying monsters are welcome.  No uniques, though - 
they are dealt with in the section pertaining to their location.<p>

This section is about <i>annoying</i> monsters.  Not necessarily very dangerous 
or life-threatening, just monsters that are your personal pet peeve with some 
attack or characteristic that infuriates you.<p>


<b>Early game:</b> <p>

<b>claw bugs</b> - Since claw bugs always ignore PV (luckily, they never damage 
            armor) and there are almost no wearable items substantially 
            increasing DV at this point in the game, fighting them in true 
            berserker mode - wearing nothing and switching tactics to berserker 
            (see section 0.14.11) might be worthwhile.  In this mode, there are 
            good bonuses to to-hit and to-damage values - usually enough to take 
            them out in one hit.  Of course, this is not necessary once the PC 
            has some missiles and/or spells to take them out.  Note that claw 
            bugs are immune to mindcraft as are all insects. They are very 
            fragile and pose a threat only due to their numerous (8 per turn!) 
            armor-punching attacks.<p>

<b>ghuls</b> - They are only dangerous because of their paralyzation ability.  
            Otherwise easy to kill.  PCs with halfway decent DV or PV should not 
            have a problem.<p>

<b>jellies</b> - Jellies can be troublesome due to several of their attacks - 
            sickness, acid, poison, paralyzation, etc.  Gray oozes and ochre 
            jellies will corrode weapons made of iron, mithril and adamantium or 
            damage the PC with their acidic attacks when fighting unarmed.  
            Gloves will be immediately destroyed.
            Mithril and adamantium weapons are more resistant to corrosion, but 
            it will happen eventually - do not attempt to clear a jelly pit in 
            melee with weapons made of iron (especially), mithril or adamantium.  
            This can be problematic for a low level PC.  Spells or missiles are 
            preferable, but if a low level PC must melee these critters, stone 
            weapons are a good choice since they do not corrode.  Alternatively, 
            the PC can wield a si and bash the jelly with it.  As an artifact, 
            the si cannot be damaged. PCs that are acid resistant will take no damage unarmed.<p>

            Gelatinous cubes can be particularly annoying because of their ability 
            to destroy items that are lying on the ground.  Losing that waterproof 
            blanket in the SMC to one of these ugly blobs is extremely frustrating.
            Easily killed with missiles, spells and mindcraft (!?).<p>

            One of the nastier jellies is the stone ooze.  The paralysis attack of 
            these can be very, very nasty for PC's who have no means of paralyzation 
            resistance (such as an amulet of free action).  Attack them from a 
            distance or run away.<p>

<b>Midgame:</b><p>

<b>dopplegangers</b> - These are frustrating because they deflect missiles and cause 
                confusion.  Doppleganger lords are somewhat more dangerous.  
                Doppleganger kings are exceptionally dangerous even for very 
                experienced PCs: they reflect the nature of the PC exactly in terms of 
                DV and PV and may inflict substantially more damage than the PC is 
                capable of dealing.  Their speed is also nearly identical to the PC's 
                although movement cost and hitpoints are not copied.  Normal 
                dopplegangers are easily killed with spells or mindcraft.  All 
                dopplegangers share an inherent weakness: they are helpless in the dark.  
                If the PC can create Darkness, from the spell, the scroll or the crystal, 
                dopplegangers are easily killed in melee.<p>

<b>Dorn beasts</b> - Annoying because of their constant paralysis attack.  An amulet of 
                free action will solve this problem.  Less well known is the tactic 
                of attacking them in darkness or while blind.  A recent report 
                suggests attacking them with missiles.  Their paralysis attack does 
                not seem to engage when using missile weapons.<p>

<b>mimics</b>   - These annoying creatures can appear in a shop when the player is 
                least expecting it (although they do not seem to show up in 
                Terinyo or Lawenilothehl, thankfully, they <i>do</i> appear in the HMV 
                shop - a warning for players that elect to descend through the UD 
                to start the game).  By the time the PC encounters them, they can 
                generally be killed; they are simply surprising and startling.  
                One is almost guaranteed in Waldenbrook's shop.  As with dopplegangers, 
                attacking in Darkness is effective. Note that tension 
                rooms full of mimics, master mimics and mimic hiveminds are much 
                more dangerous than a single mimic in a shop.<p>

<b>rust monsters</b> - These beasts will rust the PC's vulnerable armor and weapons.  
                Extremely annoying, since all they have to do is touch the PC and 
                a perfectly functioning sword of sharpness or phase dagger can be 
                reduced to a useless hunk of metal.  They can be pacified by 
                throwing metal items at them.  Quarrels are a good choice if the 
                PC has some expendable ones.  Their brethren, large rust monsters 
                and giant rust monsters, unfortunately can not be pacified in this 
                way.<p>

<b>Late game:</b><p>

<b>emperor lichs</b> - Emperor lichs are trouble.  An exception to the general rule in 
                this section, these annoying monsters are quite capable of killing 
                a PC quickly.  They cast Death Ray, so resistance is essential.  
                They see invisible, are stat drainers and are summoners.  A group 
                of emperor lichs, such as those found in greater undead vaults, is 
                a challenge even for level 50 PCs who have won the game.  They are 
                vulnerable to high effectivity fire spells.  Improved Fireball 
                with effectivity +20 or more and willpower 48 or greater is a 
                spellcaster PC's friend against emperor lichs.<p>

<b>molochs</b>  - Molochs, and their larger brethren Greater Molochs, are a significant 
                threat.  Their melee attack can be for 100 HP or significantly more 
                in the case of GMs.  They fall into the annoying category because it 
                is possible to run away from them with any PC that has halfway decent 
                speed.  They typically have a speed in the 60-70 range.<p>

<b>0.9.6 Weapon status - blessed, uncursed, cursed</b><p>

The damage inflicted on an opponent that falls into the demon or undead category is 
dependent on the weapon's blessed vs uncursed vs cursed status.  The formulas are as follows:<p>

For blessed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage × 1.5) - PV<br>
For uncursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage × 1.0) - PV<br>
For cursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage × 0.5) - PV<p>

Cursed weapons also seem to be more prone to breakage.  Blessed weapons seem to be less 
prone to breakage.<p>
