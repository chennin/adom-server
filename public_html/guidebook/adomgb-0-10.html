<H3>Corruption</H3>

<b>0.10.1 What is corruption?</b><p>

Corruption is unavoidable in the Drakalor Chain for any PC who wants 
to make progress in the game.  It is a background process that happens 
as a result of the chaos gate at the bottom of the Caverns of Chaos 
being open.  Some locations remain free of corruption despite the gate 
being open, notably those near the surface of the Drakalor Chain.  In 
order to get anything done, however, the PC must descend into corrupting 
areas.  It is only a matter of time after that until the first corruption 
occurs.  After ninety days of game time elapses, corruption rate doubles.  
After the gate is closed, background corruption ceases, which is nice if 
the PC wants to play tourist for a while.  However, corruption can still 
be caused by artifacts that corrupt (section 0.10.2.4) as well as
corrupting hits from monsters (section 0.10.2.3).<p>

Note that the possible corruptions occur in random order (not the order 
listed on this page) which is decided at the beginning of the game.  
However, if one or more corruptions are removed, the RNG is reseeded and 
the corruptions will reoccur in a new random order.<p>

The following is a complete list of corruptions along with some comments 
about their effects and workarounds:<p>

<b>A - You are surrounded by an unholy aura (Ch: -10, DV: +6).</b><p>

This causes monsters to become afraid of the PC at more or less random times.
In their frightened state, they will flee.  A very nasty side effect is that 
shopkeepers become homicidally enraged at PCs that enter shops with this 
corruption, fearing that their customers will be frightened away.<p>

<b>B - You rage (DV: -9, +6 melee damage)!</b><p>

Mediocre increase to damage in exchange for losing nine points of DV.  Not 
a very good bargain, especially for low level characters, since this will 
make them easier to hit (and some monster hits cause further corruption).<p>

<b>C - Poison drips from your hands.</b><p>

Some players hate this corruption more than any other.  PCs with this 
corruption poison any monsters they engage in melee (a nice effect), turn 
any potion they touch into poison (very bad) and curse any food they touch
(very bad).  It can result in starvation quickly.  The workaround is to wear 
thick gauntlets, which negate all of the above effects.  Alchemistic gloves 
also can negate these effects when picking up potions or food items, but it 
is not guaranteed.  However, alchemistic gloves <i>never</i> block the effects 
when drinking potions or eating food. Note that Poison Hands does not 
prevent the PC from 'U'sing herbs, 'A'pplying Alchemy or '!'dipping. Even when 
'!'dipping one potion into another, neither is turned into poison.<p>

<b>D - You have grown thorns (3d3 melee damage, Dx: -2, Ap: -3).</b><p>

The extra melee damage occurs only when fighting unarmed.  Useful for Monks 
and Beastfighters, Necromancers using Shadow Touch.  Useless waste of 2 Dx 
points for all others.<p>

<b>E - Your close attunement to corrupted astral space allows teleportation.</b><p>

Very, very nice if the PC has teleport control.  Very, very annoying if the 
PC doesn't have teleport control.<p>

<b>F - You have grown a bulging cranium (Le: +6, Wi: +4, Ap: -6, PV: -4, To: -3).</b><p>

Nice learning and willpower increases.  PV goes down because the PC's 
inflated skull is thinner, making it easier to damage?  Not good for 
looks or toughness either.<p>

<b>G - You are a living mana battery.</b><p>

Another nominee for the most hated corruption.  All wands the PC touches are 
drained of their charges.  This does not destroy them; their final charge can 
still be wrenched from them, but extremely annoying nonetheless.  There is 
no workaround.  Some side benefits: 1) every time the PC drains a 
wand, power points are added to the PC's power score: blessed wands give +2, 
uncursed +1 and cursed 0  2) Spell costs are reduced to 80% of their normal 
cost - note that this is not cumulative with Darknight / Silvernight 
reductions, since costs cannot drop below 50% 3) Mana regeneration is 
increased.<p>

<b>H - You have grown horns (+3 melee damage, Ap: -4).</b><p>

Melee damage in exchange for Appearance.<p>

<b>I - Your antennae explore the details of your environment (Ap: -4).</b><p>

Kicks in quasirandomly to reveal a bit of the dungeon layout in the PC's 
immediate vicinity.  Loss of Appearance.<p>

<b>J - Your skin is covered by tough scales (PV: +8, Dx: -6, Ap: -4).</b><p>

Nice PV increase, nasty Dexterity decrease. More loss of Appearance.<p>

<b>K - You have grown a total of 12 eyes (Ap: -6, Pe: +6).</b><p>

Nice Perception increase, still more loss of Appearance.  Getting 
the idea?  By the endgame, PCs tend to get <i>ugly</i>.  ;-)<p>

<b>L - You exhale sulphur (Ch: -4).</b><p>

This enables the PC to spit a corrosive acid much the same as a 
Drakeling's racial ability.<p>

<b>M - You look somewhat apish (St: +3, Le: -1, Wi: -1, Ch: -2, Ap: -3).</b><p>

This corruption's effects reoccur periodically.  Its effects are cumulative 
over time, so the PC keeps gaining Strength while losing Learning, Willpower, 
etc.  The game notifies you when this is happening with the phrase "You 
suddenly remember your ancestors."  Nice for fighter types, nasty for 
spellcasters.<p>

<b>N - Your corrupted tissue seems to heal much faster.</b><p>

Another corruption causing cumulative effects.  The PC heals faster, but the 
process leaves scars which reduce both Dexterity and Appearance by one point 
for each scar.  Nasty over time.<p>

<b>O - Your feet have been transformed into hooves (+8 kicking damage, Dx: -6).</b><p>

Nasty loss of Dexterity, especially since most PCs aren't kickers anyway.<p>

<b>P - You have become extremely thin and nimble (1/2 weight, DV: +6).</b><p>

Very nice corruption, probably the best.  Six points of DV with no downside.
This is one of the corruptions needed to enter the quickling tree.<p>

<b>Q - Your muscles have stiffened slowing you down (base action cost: 1500 energy
    points; PV: +4, St: +2).</b><p>

Very, very bad. Possibly the worst. Slows down all your movement by 1.5×.<p>

<b>R - You have become very light (1/10 weight, St: -6, Dx: +4, To: -6, Ap: -6,
    +20 speed).</b><p>

Bad Strength and Toughness losses in exchange for speed and Dexterity.
And yes, more appearance loss.  This is the other corruption needed to 
enter the quickling tree.<p>

Becoming corrupted beyond this point turns the PC into a chaos creature 
and the game ends at that point.  All those purple 'j's are probably former 
adventurers.<p>

<A NAME=0.10.2></A>
<b>0.10.2 Gaining corruptions</b><p>

The game keeps track of corruption with a numerical value which increments each time  
twenty turns pass in a corrupting zone. Note that there are 18 corruptions listed 
above.  For each 1000 "points" of corruption, the PC gains one corruption.  Simple 
arithmetic shows that 180 points equals 1% corruption and the PC gains a new 
corruption each time he passes a multiple of 1000/180 = 5.556%.  This is a strict
rule only up to 99% corruption.  The 99% corruption level begins at 99 × 180 = 17820 
corruption points, but the PC is given extra leeway at this point and does not 
transform into a chaos creature until the counter is over 19000 points.<p>

<b>0.10.2.1 Background corruption</b><p>

As mentioned above, the PC must eventually enter areas where background corruption 
occurs.  The following tables show the corruption points gained in various areas:<p>

Note that a corrupting level can be made less so, or even completely 
noncorrupting, by reading scrolls of peace.  These reduce the danger 
level, and thus the corruption rate of the current level.  Bless the 
scrolls before reading them.  The number of scrolls required depends on 
the level.  If Dwarftown is generated on D: 10 or D: 11, for instance, 
reading two blessed scrolls of peace will probably stop corruption.  On 
the other hand, if it is necessary to stop corruption on a particular 
level of the blue dragon caves, approximately nine scrolls of peace are 
required.<p>

<b>0.10.2.2 Corruption traps</b><p>

Corruption traps are as common as any other trap in the dungeons.
They cause a slight amount of corruption.  They are purple when
revealed.<p>


<b>0.10.2.3 Corrupting hits from monsters</b><p>

Some monsters corrupt by hitting the PC in melee.  Common ones
include chaos brothers, chaos sisters and the grues found in
the elemental temples.  Appendix J contains a complete list.<p>


<b>0.10.2.4 Artifacts which corrupt</b><p>

<b>0.10.2.4.1 Moon Sickle</b><p>

Moon Sickle is a unique artifact unlike any other in the game.  It does not
contain the essence of Chaos and Corruption and so does not corrupt merely
by carrying it.  Likewise, wielding it does not cause corruption.  However,
successfully hitting a monster with Moon Sickle adds 2d3 corruption points to
the PC's corruption counter.  Although it has no slaying powers, it is worth
considering as a weapon against very difficult monsters for those PCs who have
trained polearms, despite its corrupting nature.  It has excellent base damage
at 10d4+6 and polearms have decent to-hit and to-damage modifiers.  Remember,
however, that Moon Sickle is autocursing.<p>


<b>0.10.2.4.2 When carried</b><p>

The following artifacts contain the essence of Chaos and
Corruption and will corrupt the PC merely by carrying them:<p>

The Black Tome of Alsophocus<br>
The Amulet of Raw Steel<br>
The Shield of Raw Steel<br>
The Boots of Great Speed<br>
The Sceptre of Chaos<br>
The Medal of Chaos<br>
The Crown of Chaos<p>

Additional research will be required to quantitate the effects.<p>

<b>0.10.2.4.3 When used</b><p>

All of the Chaos Orbs fall into this category, however, there is a great deal
of difference in the amount of corruption caused by using the different Chaos
Orbs. Stephen White has determined the precise amount of corruption caused:<p>

<font face="Arial">

<table border="1">
<b>Corruption caused by using the Chaos Orbs</b><p>

<tr>
<th>Chaos Orb</th>  <th>Corruption points added per use</th>

<tr><td>Water       <td>600
<tr><td>Fire        <td>300
<tr><td>Air         <td>500
<tr><td>Earth       <td>300
<tr><td>Mana        <td>5000

</table>
</font>
<p>
Note that if a PC is wearing the elemental gauntlets when the orbs are used, 
the above corruption points are halved.<p>


<b>0.10.2.5 Potions of raw chaos</b><p>

Logically enough, if the PC drinks a potion of raw chaos it will cause
corruption.  They can also corrupt, however, if the PC tries to use
them to polymorph an item by dipping it in the potion (section 0.14.4)<p>


<b>0.10.2.6 Tracts of chaos</b><p>

Tracts of chaos are not well understood. They probably grant corruption
at the expense of piety towards the PC's chaotic god, but this needs
testing.<p>


<b>0.10.2.7 From pools</b><p>

Drinking from pools may result in the message "You feel corrupted!"
Self-explanatory.<p>


<b>0.10.2.8 From corpses</b><p>

Some corpses will corrupt the PC if eaten.  Obvious ones include the
corpses of the Chaos Orb guardians.  Others include Keethrax, Keriax
and chaos animals.<p>

<b>0.10.2.9 Riurry - the Greater Black Unicorn quest</b><p>

Riurry will reward the PC with 1 - 2 corruptions for killing the Greater
White Unicorn Yrruir.<p>


<b>0.10.2.10 Being crowned a champion of chaos</b><p>

Being crowned a champion of chaos will cause 2 - 3 immediate corruptions
in addition to making further corruption faster.<p>

<A NAME=0.10.3></A>
<b>0.10.3 Removing corruptions</b><p>

There will be a time when your PC wants to remove one or more corruptions.  Some
corruptions are very troublesome and worth getting rid of immediately.  Later in 
the game, removing corruptions may be necessary simply to extend the life of the 
PC. Whatever the reason, a thorough knowledge of how to remove corruptions should 
be part of every experienced player's repertoire.  There are several ways of doing 
this as outlined below.  Corruption removal items are among the most precious in 
the game.  They should always be blessed unless the PC is trying to specifically 
remove only one corruption that is impossible to deal with (poison hands can be 
impossible to deal with without thick gauntlets) while preserving others (for 
instance one needed to enter the quickling tree).<p>


<b>0.10.3.1 Potions of cure corruption</b><p>

Potions of cure corruption are exactly what the name implies - they remove corruption,
approximately 0.75 corruptions for each blessed potion of cure corruption the PC drinks.
A potion of cure corruption is also a quest object for Gaab'Baay.<p>

Beware of cursed potions of cure corruption.  They cause corruption rather 
than curing it.<p>

Magnus Malm has done some research on potions of cure corruption:<p>

</table>
</font>
<p>

<b>0.10.3.1.1 Obtaining potions of cure corruption from Guth'Alak</b><p>

Potions of cure corruption can be obtained from the druid Guth'Alak in Terinyo.
He will reward a non-chaotic PC with a potion of cure corruption for delivering a
greater chaos creature's or highly corrupted creature's corpse to him.  Examples
are the corpses of Chaos Orb guardians, Keriax and Keethrax.  Black unicorn corpses
and greater black unicorn corpses also work.  If the PC is chaotic, it is a good
idea to sell a chaos creature's corpse to Munxip for safekeeping, then buy it back
at a later time when the PC is non-chaotic.  It can then be traded to Guth'Alak for
a potion of cure corruption.<p>


<b>0.10.3.2 Scrolls of chaos resistance</b><p>

Blessed scrolls of chaos resistance remove about 1.5 corruptions per reading. There are
several places where scrolls of chaos resistance can be obtained: The only absolutely
guaranteed location is the hidden room in the High Mountain Village. This will always
contain one scroll of chaos resistance, although beware - it is always cursed.
Khelavaster will give six scrolls of chaos resistance to a PC that manages to save him.
The dwarven mystic in Dwarftown usually gives four blessed scrolls of chaos resistance
to neutral PCs.  Finally, the Mad Minstrel will reward a PC who brings him the Weird
Tome with five cursed scrolls of chaos resistance.<p>

Beware of cursed scrolls of chaos resistance.  They cause corruption rather
than curing it.<p>

Magnus Malm has done some research on scrolls of chaos resistance:<p>

<font face="Arial">

<table border="1">
<caption>Scrolls of chaos resistance</caption>

<tr>
<th>Status</th>  <th colspan="10">Ten trials: corruption points added or removed</th>                                <th>Min</th> <th>Ave</th> <th>Max</th>

<tr><td>Cursed  <td>+293 <td>+286 <td>+301 <td>+304 <td>+324 <td>+304 <td>+311 <td>+307 <td>+284 <td>+299 <td>+284 <td>+301 <td>+324
<tr><td>Uncursed<td>-595 <td>-567 <td>-539 <td>-565 <td>-618 <td>-514 <td>-562 <td>-552 <td>-500 <td>-533 <td>-500 <td>-555 <td>-618

</table>
</font>
<p>

Note that these numbers are to a first approximation double those of potions of cure
corruption. Thus cursed SoCRs are twice as bad as cursed PoCCs, while blessed SoCRs are
twice as good as blessed PoCCs.  The implications should be obvious: never drink or read 
any cursed corruption removal item, and bless SoCRs in any but a dire emergency.<p>


<b>0.10.3.3 Tracts of order</b><p>

Reading a tract of order amounts to an appeal to the lawful god for corruption removal. 
This is not free and uses up piety. Do not try this with a PC who does not have a very 
good relationship with his lawful god.  In any case, the amount of corruption removed
appears to be small. Tracts of order are most useful to get rid of an annoying corruption 
as soon as it occurs, thus reseeding the RNG and hopefully avoiding it the next time a PC 
receives a corruption.<p>


<b>0.10.3.4 Yrruir - the Greater White Unicorn quest</b><p>

Yrruir will remove all corruption <i>once</i> as a reward for the PC killing the 
Greater Black Unicorn - Riurry.  It is wise to wait to use this cleansing until 
it is absolutely necessary. If the PC is doing a normal ending, this should 
ideally be the last thing the PC does before leaving the Drakalor Chain to 
insure a corruption-free ending, which leads to better scores and a happier 
future history for the PC when the game is finished.<p>
