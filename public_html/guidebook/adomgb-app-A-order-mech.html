AMULETS OF ORDER - MECHANICS BY MALTE HELMERT

1. What is alignment?
=====================
Each PC has an "alignment score", which can be queried by reading a 
scroll of balance. It can be negative (if there are black stones on the 
scale) or positive (if there are white stones on the scale), or zero (if 
the scale is balanced). The number of stones on the scale determines the 
absolute value of the alignment score, so 3000 black stones = -3000, 
1000 white stones = +1000.

The score corresponds to alignments as follows:
   C-: -10000 ... -5000
   C :  -4999 ... -1251
   CN:  -1250 ... -1000
   NC:   -999 ... -750
   N-:   -749 ... -126
   N=:   -125 ... +125
   N+:   +126 ... +749
   NL:   +750 ... +999
   LN:  +1000 ... +1250
   L :  +1251 ... +4999
   L+:  +5000 ... +6000
Scores lower than -10000 or higher than +6000 are not possible.


2. How do amulets of order work?
================================
Amulets of order, if equipped, add a random amount of points to the PC's 
alignment score at regular intervals.

* Blessed amulets of order are activated every 10 turns (whenever the
   turn counter is a multiple of 10).
* Uncursed amulets of order are activated every 20 turns (whenever the
   turn counter is a multiple of 20).
* Cursed amulets of order are activated every 50 turns (whenever the
   turn counter is a multiple of 50).

This is based on the *turn counter*, not on game time, so if you want 
the alignment change to happen quickly, you'd better spend your turns 
doing fast things (like walking around in a dungeon in blessed 
seven-league boots) and not wait around on the wilderness map.

Specifically, this should give you a rough idea of how much time 1000 
turns take for a PC with speed 100:
- ~10   hours if the PC is resting or walking without seven league boots
               (not on the wilderness map).
- ~5    hours if the PC is walking (*not resting*) with blessed seven
               league boots.
- ~1000 hours if the PC is resting or walking in the Wilderness without
               seven league boots (more if terrain is difficult).

After the amulet has added points to the alignment score of the PC, a 
message is displayed if the PC is not lawful (i.e. his *new* alignment 
score is +999 or less). Note that this happens even when the amount 
added to the alignment score is zero, so getting the message is not an 
indication of the amulet being effective.

If the PC is now neutral, the message is:
   "You notice an itching feeling around your neck."
If the PC is now chaotic, the message is:
   "You feel a burning pain around your neck!"

In the latter case, the PC also loses 1d3 hit points.

To come up with this formula and verify it, I recorded the exact amount 
of damage 1000 times for various PCs. In each case, the relative 
frequencies of ones, twos and threes match a 1d3 roll:

   uncursed amulet, Level 1,  Raven:    1: 328,  2: 351,  3: 321
   uncursed amulet, Level 50, Raven:    1: 343,  2: 321,  3: 336
   uncursed amulet, Level 1,  Unicorn:  1: 328,  2: 359,  3: 313
   uncursed amulet, Level 1,  Tree:     1: 354,  2: 350,  3: 296
   blessed  amulet, Level 1,  Raven:    1: 340,  2: 334,  3: 326
   cursed   amulet, Level 1,  Raven:    1: 335,  2: 343,  3: 322

The complicated thing, then, is determining by what amount the PC's 
alignment score is changed upon activation of the amulet. This is the 
topic of the next section.


3. By what amount do amulets of order change the PC's alignment?
================================================================
This is influenced by three factors: blessed/uncursed/cursed status of 
the amulet, birth sign of the PC, and level of the PC. In 
pre-experiments, I noticed that only the Tree birth sign behaves 
differently from the norm, so only two birth signs were tested, Raven 
for the baseline and Tree for the special case.

In total, there are 3 * 2 * 50 = 300 different combinations of those 
features. For each of those, I repeated the following procedure a 
thousand times, for a total of 300,000 data points:
   1. Read a blessed scroll of balance.
   2. Wait until the amulet is activated for the next time
      (i.e. until the turn counter is a multiple of 10/20/50, depending
      on the blessed/uncursed/cursed status of the amulet).
   3. Read a blessed scroll of balance and record the change in the
      alignment score.

I first had a close look at a few data points and formulated a 
hypothesis from looking at those. This hypothesis perfectly matched the 
additional data I obtained later, so I think it is correct. The formula 
is as follows:

1. Roll 1d3 for a cursed amulet, 1d6 for an uncursed amulet, 1d10 for
    a blessed amulet.
2. If this value is greater than 1, subtract 1 if the PC was born under
    the Tree birth sign. The Tree birth sign has no effect if the roll
    already was 1.
3. Multiply this by (51 - level) / 50, rounding the result down.
    This is the final amount which is added to the PC's alignment score.

Using this information, we can calculated by how many points the PC's 
alignment is changed on average for a given combination of 
blessed/uncursed/cursed status, birth sign, and PC level.

As an example, consider an uncursed amulet and a PC born under the Tree 
birth sign with an experience level of 15.
If the initial roll is a 1 or 2, we get 1 * 36 / 50 rounded down = 0.
If the initial roll is a 3, we get 2 * 36 / 50 rounded down = 1.
If the initial roll is a 4, we get 3 * 36 / 50 rounded down = 2.
If the initial roll is a 5, we get 4 * 36 / 50 rounded down = 2.
If the initial roll is a 6, we get 5 * 36 / 50 rounded down = 3.

So we get 0 with probability 2/6, 1 with probability 1/6,
2 with probability 2/6, and 3 with probability 1/6, resulting in an 
expected value of 8/6 or 4/3 = 1.3333... .

So blessed amulets are more effective than uncursed amulets (and even 
more than cursed ones) on two accounts: They are activated more often, 
and they result in a bigger change of alignment when activated.

The following tables show the expected change of alignment for the 
different types of amulet, birth signs and player levels after 600 turns 
have passed, so that both factors are taken into account. I chose 600 
because it is the smallest number such that all quantities in the table 
are integers.

[Note: These tables could be better presented as a single table by using 
rows for the levels and columns for the six cases. If anybody wants, I 
can prepare such a table after the weekend. Right now, I don't have the 
time.]

Blessed amulet, any birth sign except Tree:

PC level:                 1    2-6      7      8      9  10-11     12
Change in alignment:    330    270    258    252    246    240    228

PC level:                13  14-15     16     17  18-19  20-21     22
Change in alignment:    222    210    204    198    180    174    162

PC level:                23  24-26  27-28     29  30-31     32  33-34
Change in alignment:    156    150    120    114    108     96     90

PC level:             35-36  37-38     39  40-41     42     43     44
Change in alignment:     72     60     48     42     30     24     18

PC level:                45     46  47-50
Change in alignment:     12      6      0

So in this case, which is the most important one, the amulet stops 
working at PC level 47. However, even at slightly lower levels its 
effect is marginal, so that the amulet gets near useless somewhere in 
the 40s. For example, at level 46 it would take 500,000 turns to get 
from N= to L+.

Uncursed amulet, any birth sign except Tree:

PC level:                 1    2-9  10-11  12-13  14-17  18-21  22-26
Change in alignment:    105     75     70     65     60     50     45

PC level:             27-31  32-34  35-38  39-41     42  43-50
Change in alignment:     30     25     15     10      5      0

Cursed amulet, any birth sign except Tree:

Change in alignment:     24     12      8      4      0

PC level:                13  14-15  16-17  18-19  20-21     22     23

4. The data
===========
If anybody feels like looking at the data and coming up with their own 
hypotheses, here it is. The "avg." column doesn't list the actual 
averages of the data points, but rather the "expected" average according 
to the hypothesized formula.
