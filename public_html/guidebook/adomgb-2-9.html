<H3>The Pyramid</H3>

<A HREF="adomgb-2-9-pic.html" target="blank">Click here </A> for color maps of the Pyramid.<p>

The pyramid is located in the wilderness, slightly east of the exact center of the map.  
It can be entered once the PC reaches experience level 13.  When this happens, the game 
generates a message: "You suddenly feel ancient magical energies manifest in your 
vicinity."  Searching the current location will reveal the papyrus scroll, which is an 
invitation to enter the pyramid.  It is not necessary to read, or even find, the scroll 
for admission to the pyramid.  It asks the PC to come as soon as possible.  Do not be 
fooled by this.  It is best to wait as long as possible before entering the pyramid, 
since it is a rather nasty place.  The entrance to the pyramid closes permanently if 
the PC reaches experience level 17.  Ideally the PC should reach experience level 16 and 
keep very careful track of his experience points.  Approach the pyramid when the PC is 
close to achieving level 17, within a couple hundred points.  Wander around in the 
vicinity of the pyramid to generate wilderness encounters.  Killing monsters in the 
wilderness should enable the player to fine-tune his experience score to the point where 
very few additional points are needed to achieve level 17.  Then enter the pyramid.  
The first couple of kills in the pyramid will raise the PC to experience level 17, 
maximizing the chances of success in the pyramid.  Keep a <i>very</i> close eye on those 
experience points.  You don't want to accidentally achieve level 17 and have the pyramid 
close, because Rehetep carries two artifacts.<p>

Once the PC has killed Rehetep, the pyramid remains open permanently. The fact that it 
closes at PC experience level 17 if Rehetep remains alive is a <i>potential game-breaker</i>. 
If the PC drops a Chaos Orb in the Pyramid, then achieves experience level 17 outside without 
killing Rehetep, the game is over. Since the Chaos Orb is inside an inaccessible location, it 
will never be possible to open the passage to D:49. Note this same scenario can occur with 
the Ruined City (Minotaur Maze, section 2.20).<p>

<b>2.9.1 The first two levels</b><p>

The first level of the pyramid has the following layout:<p>
<pre>
 ###########                              #######

     ####################       ##############                 ###
</pre>
The numeral 1 is used to indicate the presence of a secret door.  Note the traps.  These 
are guaranteed traps.  There will also be a number of non-guaranteed traps present. The 
location of the non-guaranteed traps changes from game to game.  Also note the tools 
represented by the ( symbol.  This cache of tools is guaranteed and includes thieves' 
picks, a climbing set and a pickaxe.  The tools are always located on top of a trap.<p>

Among the traps is the first guaranteed corruption trap in the game.  It can be exploited 
to gain corruption if desired.  The astral plane corruption which grants teleportitis, 
for instance, may make certain tasks much easier.  This is very risky of course, since 
the order corruptions will occur in is unknown.<p>

The inhabitants of this level include (greater) mummies, ghosts, spectres, jackal demons, 
jackalweres, jackals and hyenas.  Mummies can cause sickness.  It is very unwise to enter 
the pyramid without some means of dealing with sickness.  The fastest and easiest way to 
cure sickness is with blessed or uncursed curaria mancox herbs.<p>

The second level of the pyramid has the following layout:<p>
<pre>
   ###         ###### #######
   #.###########....# #^^^^^#
   #....^.....##.######1###^#####
  ####.######....#.....^.##^#...#

  #...###.##.######.....###.###
  ##### #.....#   #.##### #.#
        #######   ###     ###
</pre>
Again the numeral 1 indicates secret doors.  This level is very similar to the first level 
in terms of monsters and traps.  There is no guaranteed equipment here.<p>


<b>2.9.2 The top level</b><p>

The top level of the pyramid has the following layout:<p>
<pre>
      #######
     ##..Z..##
    ##.......##

#Z@.............@Z#

</pre>
There is a unique feature on this level. The down staircase, represented by the > symbol, 
changes location randomly when the PC enters the level. This forces the PC to fight 
his way to the new location if a retreat is necessary. This reoccurs if the PC descends. 
Furthermore, the monsters on the level will not follow the PC down the stairs. In older 
gammas of ADOM, it was possible to lure the monsters down the stairs one at a time and 
dispatch them. This does not work in 1.1.1.<p>

The Z at the top represents Rehetep, the Mummy Lord.  The remaining Zs are mummies.  The & 
characters are jackal demons, which have a confusion attack.  The @ characters represent a 
random monster, generally somewhat out of depth, but not terribly so.  Bear in mind that 
mummies see invisible.  If the PC is fortunate enough to have a means of invisibility at 
this point, use it and take out the mummies first.<p>

If the PC has a means of controlled on demand teleportation, the fight becomes simpler. 
Rehetep normally recites a speech as soon as the PC moves, waking all the other monsters 
on the level. In ADOM 1.1.1 (but not 1.0.0), if the PC teleports adjacent to Rehetep on 
arrival, he does not speak and the PC only has to fight Rehetep and the two jackal demons 
nearest to him.<p>

<b>2.9.2.1 Rehetep</b><p>

Rehetep the Mummy Lord holds two powerful artifacts, the Ankh and the Ancient Mummy 
Wrapping.  A Greater Identify of each is below:<p>

----------------- blessed ancient mummy wrapping [+1, +5] {Ap-8}---------------<p>

It is an artifact.<p>

When worn it modifies DV by +1 and PV by +5.<br>
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of<br>
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1<br>
points of damage.<p>

It modifies your appearance attribute by -8.<br>
It grants resistance to sleep attacks.<br>
It grants resistance to stunning.<br>
It grants resistance to death attacks.<br>
It grants the ability to see invisible things.<br>
It grants IMMUNITY to cold attacks.<p>

--------------------------------- uncursed ankh--------------------------------<p>

It is an artifact.<p>

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +2.<br>
When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points of<br>
damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3<br>
points of damage.<p>

It increases your luck.<br>
It grants luck.<br>
It makes Fate smile upon you.<p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

Note that the [+2, +2] nature of the Ankh is not revealed explicitly except when 
Greater Identified.  Note also that it not only grants the Lucky and Fate Smiles 
intrinsics, but also increases luck, a hidden property used by the game when calculating 
dice rolls, etc.<p>

The artifact Ancient Mummy Wrapping is the only mummy wrapping that weighs 60 stones.  
Be sure not to confuse it with other mummy wrappings.  They are all described as a 
"strange wrapping" prior to identification.  The resistances granted by the Ancient Mummy 
Wrapping are considerable and should give clues about how to attack Rehetep.  Using cold 
based attacks is, of course, useless.  Rehetep and other mummies are vulnerable to 
fire.  This is where the wand of fireballs available from Thrundarr as a quest reward 
comes in very handy.  Do not give up when messages about Rehetep "shrugging off" fire
based attacks are generated.  He will succumb to repeated fire attacks.  All mummies 
including Rehetep are vulnerable to undead slayers, of course.<p>

Note that the combination of cold immunity and the see invisible intrinsic available from 
the Ancient Mummy Wrapping makes Li-Hon-Kay, a potential 20th Arena fight opponent, much 
easier to defeat.<p>
