Lawenilothehl is an outlaw village found to the southwest of Terinyo. 
The name is an anagram of "hole in the wall", American slang for a 
shabby place.  It contains a variety of shady characters who can be 
useful.<p>


<b>1.2.2.1 Yergius</b><p>

Yergius is the head of the Thieves' Guild.  He can teach or train a 
variety of useful skills for non-lawful PCs.  They are Climbing, 
Detect Traps, Disarm traps, Pick locks, Pick Pockets and Stealth.  
Yergius teaches Pick Pockets to any non-lawful PC at no cost.  Bear in 
mind that obtaining even the Pick Pockets skill from Yergius is a 
chaotic act.  He will only teach or train the remainder of these skills 
once the PC has demonstrated his talents as a thief.  In practice, this 
means that the PC must successfully use the Pick Pockets skill 28 times 
(according to the recent best estimates) against monsters vulnerable to 
this skill.  This includes most humanoids, constructs and undead.  
Animals in general do not have pockets to pick, although ratlings (not 
rats or giant rats, but archers, duelists, fencers, etc.) are vulnerable.  
A successful application of the skill will result in a stolen item being 
added to the PC's inventory, or the message "The -foo- does not seem to 
own anything valuable."  Note that Yergius' initial training results in 
a Pick Pockets skill level of one.  This means that it is not really 
useful for picking pockets until it is trained and an experience level 
or two has been gained, thus making it eligible for advancement.  It is 
useful for angering nonhostile villagers.  Those villagers in line of 
sight may also become hostile. Fumbled Pick Pockets attempts are thus a 
way to generate hostile villagers without Confusion Blast, Stun Ray or 
Ventriloquism. Thrundarr has been moved off his lever with a low Pick 
Pockets skill.<p>


Using the Pick Pockets skill against nonhostile monsters or monsters that 
are unaware of the PC is a relatively minor chaotic act, and 
furthermore seems to have a limited alignment effect.  PCs never seem 
to become C- by using Pick Pockets.<p>

It is also apparently possible to satisfy Yergius by robbing shops, 
but the quantitation is not understood.  Furthermore, he will not teach 
Pick Pockets to a PC that has already robbed a shop.  So if you want a 
PC to have access to the Pick Pockets skill, <b><i>do not rob shops before 
obtaining the skill</i></b>.  Robbing shops is a very risky activity for 
PC's less than experience level 20 anyway.<p>

The main initial reason for attempting this quest is to satisfy Yergius 
and receive the Detect Traps skill from him.  This makes the underground 
level of the Dwarven Graveyard and the Pyramid in general much easier 
and safer, not to mention the elemental temples.<p>

After satisfying Yergius he will teach new skills for prices ranging from 
3000 - 4000 gold pieces.  Detect Traps in particular is well worth the 
3500 gold pieces it costs.  He will also offer training of two different 
types: theoretical and practical.  Theoretical training will raise the 
PC's dice modifier available when experience level advancement occurs.  
The maximum is +4d5.  This is simply a matter of cash.  If the PC has 
plenty of money available and wants to maximize a skill that Yergius 
trains quickly, pay him whatever is required to get the modifier to +4d5.  
The second form of training he offers is practical.  When the PC trains 
in this way, it adds successful skill checks to the skill, making it 
easier to advance.  This also is a matter of cash.  It is a very good 
idea to use this practical training if the PC is about to face an area 
where a newly learned skill will be needed.  Again, the underground level 
of the Dwarven Graveyard and the Pyramid are obvious examples of areas 
where the Detect Traps skill will be needed, while the PC has probably 
had little time to train the skill.<p>

Another example where Yergius' theoretical and practical training can be 
very useful is the Climbing skill.  Climbing = 100 is required for entering 
the Rift, which is something all spellcasters should seriously consider 
for access to the Sinister Library of Niltrias.  Trolls should also visit 
the Library for much-needed experience.  It is possible to train Climbing 
without Yergius' assistance, for example by mountaineering, but this takes 
place in the wilderness, thus wasting large amounts of valuable time.<p>

PCs who kill Yergius become the new head of the Thieves' Guild 
and as such receive 50% off the prices at Barnabas' black market (see next 
section).  Of course killing him means that he is no longer available 
for training, so take advantage of his training before killing him.<p>

Yergius also sells thieves' picks to non-lawful PCs with the Pick Locks 
skill who have no Thieves' Picks.<p>

<b>1.2.2.2 Barnabas</b><p>

Barnabas maintains a general store type of shop in Lawenilothehl.  As 
might be expected from the general atmosphere in the town, it is a black 
market.  As such, the prices demanded are very high.  Nevertheless, it 
is worth visiting.  Simply observing what is for sale identifies items.  
Barnabas also usually has rocks for sale at relatively reasonable prices, 
which can be tremendously useful for hurthlings.  Barnabas occasionally 
has high quality items for sale, which can be within the monetary reach 
of PCs who have done the Kranach quest. In addition to the 50% reduction 
in prices for being head of the Thieves' Guild (see above section 1.2.2.1), 
Barnabas also changes his offers when the PC sells items: 1/4 of base value 
for nonmembers, 1/3 of base value for members and 1/2 of base value if the 
PC is the head of the Thieves' Guild, regardless of whether he was a former 
member or alignment.<p>

<b>1.2.2.3 Kranf Niest</b><p>

Kranf Niest is a nefarious doctor in Lawenilothehl.  He can teach PCs 
the Healing skill after completing Hotzenplotz's Jharod quest.  Kranf 
Niest does not have the gentle touch of Jharod.  When a chaotic PC 
learns the Healing skill from him, the PC is teleported away in a 
stunned and confused state, loses 1d3 points in each of the Appearance, 
Learning and Willpower categories and is corrupted slightly (1%).  
During this process, Kranf Niest removes any helmet the PC might be 
wearing, even if it is cursed.  If the PC already has Healing, Kranf 
Niest gives the PC a scalpel and stethoscope.  It is a chaotic act to 
attack Kranf Niest, but the PC receives a small net lawful boost for 
killing him.<p>

<b>1.2.2.4 Skriek</b><p>

Skriek is a ratling found in Lawenilothehl.  He sells random keys for 
the seemingly exorbitant price of 470 + (30 × PCs experience level) gold 
pieces (verified to experience level 11) to male PCs. Female PCs receive 
a 50% discount. Skriek becomes hostile if the PC kills Hotzenplotz, one 
of Tywat Pare's quests, but can be lured away from Terinyo, in which case 
he will continue to sell keys.<p>

<b>1.2.2.5 Hotzenplotz and his guards</b><p>

Hotzenplotz is a crime lord found in Lawenilothehl.  He assigns two 
quests.  The first is to kill Jharod, the healer.  Jharod, and thus this 
quest, is only available if the PC has chosen Rynt's Yrrigs quest rather 
than Guth'Alak's Keethrax quest.  Hotzenplotz arranges for Kranf Niest to 
teach the Healing skill as a reward.  The second is to kill Tywat Pare.  
The reward is an amulet of Chaos.  If the PC is on a mission from Tywat 
Pare to kill Hotzenplotz, a couple of points are worth remembering.  
Hotzenplotz is fairly tough and uses poison.  He will kill a PC without 
poison resistance in melee quite easily.  Second, he does not heal.  A 
PC can attack him, run away into the wilderness and repeat this process 
until he is dead.  The combination of these two characteristics should 
make it clear that the best way to attack him is with missiles or ranged 
spells.<p>

It is possible for a relatively low level PC (especially hurthlings) to 
kill him with thrown rocks, but special tactics are necessary. Lure him 
out of his hut and flee towards the right side of town while pelting him 
with rocks. Leave town and reenter from the left. Continue to throw rocks 
until he succumbs.<p>

Hotzenplotz sees invisible. Do not rely on invisibility when engaging him.<p>

Hotzenplotz and his guards can be exploited. They will often attack hostile 
monsters that are led into their hut. If one of the nastier monsters found 
in Lawenilothehl (assassin, outlaw leader) attacks a weak PC, run for 
Hotzenplotz's hut.<p>

<b>1.2.2.6 Other inhabitants of Lawenilothehl</b><p>

The other inhabitants are simply flavor elements with no real role in 
the game.  They include assassins, muggers, beggars, cutpurses, bandits, 
outlaws and outlaw leaders.  Beggars are useful because they will drop a 
potion of booze if the PC gives them ~50 gold pieces and then 'C'hats with 
them.  It is always cursed.  Remember Yggaz, the fool in Terinyo, will 
trade random potions for potions of booze.<p>
